Not a video chat just text. \\n\\nThere were a couple little errors in grammar during the chat that I was suspicious of, but I had also just completed a legit interview with a multi-national car manufacturer for a local on site position and I can understand having english as a second language, not everything is perfect. \\n\\nAlarm bells really started ringing when during the interview they asked if my phone carrier was pre-paid or post paid and who it was. \\n\\nThey also asked about direct deposit and who my bank was with and how long I had been a customer. Now normally I wouldn't lie in an interview but I told them it would be through one of the too big to fail banks. I figured I'd just open a new account if it turned out to be legit. I didn't even bother to answer about the time length. \\n\\nThey said they had gotten my resume online but they still needed my address. Yet another red flag. \\n\\nFinally the nuclear bomb drop was when they said they would have to send me a check to buy the equipment and would talk to me more on Monday. \\n\\nI found the website and a mention is Fast Company magazine through a google search and while it seems a real company, it still had some issues. No contact us links and no info on where HQ was. I found supposed employees on LinkedIn and one even seemed like she was in the role I had just been hired for. \\n\\nI messaged her and the poor girl had been victimized by this scam and she helped to confirm all my suspicions. \\n\\nThe company name is Cabinet Health and they are in Series B startup mode so it might be a real company. \\n\\nTL:DR: If a company interviews you through chat only, it might be a scam. If they mention sending you a check to buy equipment, it is 100% a scam.\",\n",

       " \"Another WFH Scam I have been applying for jobs lately and got a text message about a work from home CSR job paying $22 an hour which seems a little high but not completely unrealistic.\\n\\nFirst red flag is that they texted me directly instead of an email or message through a job board. \\n\\nThe second red flag is that the interview was all through a MS Teams chat. Not a video chat just text. \\n\\nThere were a couple little errors in grammar during the chat that I was suspicious of, but I had also just completed a legit interview with a multi-national car manufacturer for a local on site position and I can understand having english as a second language, not everything is perfect. \\n\\nAlarm bells really started ringing when during the interview they asked if my phone carrier was pre-paid or post paid and who it was. \\n\\nThey also asked about direct deposit and who my bank was with and how long I had been a customer. Now normally I wouldn't lie in an interview but I told them it would be through one of the too big to fail banks. I figured I'd just open a new account if it turned out to be legit. I didn't even bother to answer about the time length. \\n\\nThey said they had gotten my resume online but they still needed my address. Yet another red flag. \\n\\nFinally the nuclear bomb drop was when they said they would have to send me a check to buy the equipment and would talk to me more on Monday. \\n\\nI found the website and a mention is Fast Company magazine through a google search and while it seems a real company, it still had some issues. No contact us links and no info on where HQ was. I found supposed employees on LinkedIn and one even seemed like she was in the role I had just been hired for. \\n\\nI messaged her and the poor girl had been victimized by this scam and she helped to confirm all my suspicions. \\n\\nThe company name is Cabinet Health and they are in Series B startup mode so it might be a real company. \\n\\nTL:DR: If a company interviews you through chat only, it might be a scam. If they mention sending you a check to buy equipment, it is 100% a scam.\",\n",

It’s been a dream I get to sleep in no commute I’ve watched literally everything on netflix. I’ve done all the things I’ve always wanted to but always held off because work got in the way. For years big corps have been sitting on there asses making crazy money off our work. I think it’s our turn to sit at home and collect cheques. I just don’t get it’s so frustrating I did everything right I played the whole “ oh I’m so productive this is so much better the the office ” card but they didn’t bite. I don’t know what to do I feel like I’m gonna melt down, 2 years at home “working” collecting a cheque every Friday and now it’s over I actually have to go in and be productive. God help me 😪😪😢😭😖😟',\n",
       " \"Extraverted boss wants me back in the office. How do I tell her no? I work for a very small company (less than 20 people). For the last two years, I've been allowed to WFH the majority of the time. It's been amazing for my overall mood and productivity and I love the flexibility it brings to my day. I'm very introverted and find the office environment to be draining and distracting. I've had to go into the office for about 2-3 months last year (some of that was hybrid). I was told that I needed to be there in case they needed help with clients (never happened). My office was upstairs in a corner where I was mostly left alone since no one else up there was back in the office yet. My boss informed me this week that I'll be coming back into the office next week for at least the next month and then maybe they'll think about letting me work from home a day or two a week (unlikely). Unlike last time, my office got moved downstairs so I can help out with clients, since we are going to be short a receptionist. Plus almost everyone will be back in the office, so the noise levels and interruptions will increase. We are starting up in-person client meetings and the head boss doesn't want us to use the bathroom during those times. There could be meetings anywhere from 2 to 6 hours a day! I'm so miserable at the idea of going back. I plan on job searching, but I would really appreciate any ideas on how to tell my boss that coming back into the office is untenable. When she talked to me there was no room for my feedback, as though her mind was made up even though she knows I adamantly want to WFH. Any suggestions?\",\n",

       " 'WFH Lunchtime is something else I just started a new job. I get a half hour paid lunch. \\n\\nAt my old job - in fast food - my UNPAID lunch was spent sitting and staring at the wall, because it was my time to zone out. No customers. No drinks. But there was the dread of going back. Of donning a headset. Sometimes I’d forget a lunch and I’d eat some crap, processed breakfast sandwich. \\n\\nLunch now? I took out my dog. I vacuumed. I made a healthy wrap. I snuggled my kitty. I felt re-energized. It wasn’t a break FROM work, it was a brief return to life.',\n",
       " \"Work from Home Manifesto I have worked the last 2 years at home, having just started a new position before going home for COVID. This has been the best 2 years of my life. Being able to spend this much time with my family and seeing my kids grow up. I wouldn’t trade it for the world. Going back to the office was always inevitable. My company has never changed their tune, and I understand their opinion and decision. My company hasn’t changed, but I have. I have changed opinion not only because of my family, but I’ve also changed my opinion on what is the most effective way to do my job. Not only have I enjoyed working from home to be around my family, I have been able to focus more on my work. I have developed more, I have learned more, and I am more effective on a daily basis. More than I can be driving into the office.\\n\\nI know some have a different opinion that there is an invaluable experience in working in an office and collaborating with others. I personally don’t know if I believe this or not. I don’t know if I’d have the skills I have today, having worked in an office for this long. Maybe I wouldn’t have learned and grown as much. Or maybe like the last 2 years, I would have learned and grown faster. I do know that the majority of people saying you need to be in the office, also have power over people in the office and they have the biggest desks, and offices with doors. Maybe they’ve spent so much time and energy acquiring this office stature that they don’t want to lose that?\\n\\nI know some are saying just suck it up and be a man, or woman. Be a man, or woman, and just drive into work. I believe a man, or woman, should suck it up and go to work, and provide for their family. The question is what does your job entail? Are you driving to work in a cubicle farm because you think that’s the profitable thing for the company? If you’re like me and believe you're more profitable for the company when you’re working from home, then you’re just driving to the cubicle farm for your boss. You are being your boss’ bitch. Then you’re going around calling others childish.\\n\\nIn conclusion I’ve poured a lot of time and effort into doing a great job for my company the last 2 years. Now I feel like I’m asked to drive in (take a pay cut). Give up time at home. And perform my job less effectively. Who’s winning? The person in the big office probably sleeps better, I hope the power trip improves their sex too.\",\n",

Hey, I'm fairly new into a job now (a few months) and it's a good job, but the commute is tiring and I'm spending quite a bit of my salary on just petrol.

From landscaping, fencing, roofing, to repairing &amp; restoring tennis &amp; basketball courts. \\n\\nI was introduced to WFH through my ex last year. We had started spending a lot of time together and she was over a lot so it was only convenient for her to start working from home at my place. Some call center insurance thing, I’m not really sure. Point is, even though I’ve always known of WFH jobs existing, especially with them popping up a lot more during the pandemic, I never for a second considered I could ever find a decent position at a place I’d want to work that would pay me what doing labor work was. I mean while it’s nice to sit home all day and not sweat in the summer heat, my ex was only making like 15-16/hr while I was doing 22. I mean the difference is negligible but it was enough for me to keep the ideations of leaving my job in the back of my head… until three weeks ago. \\n\\nWe have these times off around this season as it starts to get to cold to work with paint on tennis courts, so instead we’re put on unemployment and told to come back around spring. Most of the guys I work with simply go back to their home countries during this time (el salvador mostly) or hunker down collecting unemployment while doing minimal under the table work in the meantime. It’s not a bad deal tbh, 400 a week plus whatever you make under the table. \\n\\nTrouble for me was, I lost my car 2 weeks ago. That halted any traveling I could do to make money in the meantime while also collecting unemployment. And so these ideations came circling back around. \\n\\nThe problem as I saw it was, my resume consisted of nothing that would even remotely reflect I would perform well at a call center. I mean I’ve never even been to college. So what do I do? I go to r/resumes and scour the bunch for something I can use that would reflect well to potential WFH employers. I don’t straight up steal someone’s resume, what I did is pick &amp; choose from multiple people’s descriptions of their jobs, people’s accolades/achievements, even goddamn degrees &amp; certificates. \\n\\nThen I went on indeed and probably applied to about 20 places in the span of like 30 minutes. It was about midnight I was doing this. I wake up the next morning to a text at 8:39am asking if I’m me. I say yes and this is the copy &amp; pasted reply I get, names changed. \\n\\n“I’m Mr. Bean from Big Bean. Your resume has been reviewed for the position of a Customer Services Representative, we would like to invite you to an interview and we pay nothing less than $30 hourly, Kindly reply if you are still interested for more info. Thank you!” \\n\\nLong story short (I know I just told the entire story, please forgive me I am black this is what we do) we go through the interview process and I absolutely crush it because I’m really good with words (it was a text interview through Wire). I was extremely skeptical the entire time thinking I was being scammed, waiting for the ball to drop where I’m asked to send in a photo id with ssn or something along those lines. But no, it was a fairly typical interview, took about an hour, and I was told I impressed the interviewer and his superiors. They promptly sent me an offer letter &amp; w-4 form which I signed &amp; sent back.\\n\\nMind you, this isn’t the first time I’ve lied to get a job. Hell, it’s not even close to the most egregious lie to get a job I’ve done. But it’s insane to me that I could still lie for this level of income. \\n\\nTL;DR: title',\n",

       " 'I can\\'t go back Hello. 37yo female here, working from home for the past year and a half. At the beginning of the pandemic, our incredible boss found a new job and we inherited a boss from another office (job was supposed to be advertised ... hasn\\'t been yet and his old position was eliminated and I was directed to remove the word \"interim\" from his title on our website so ... ). After 3 months of being home during the pandemic, one of our team members died (cancer). We are a small team of 8 (now 7). We transitioned well to working from home and went full steam ahead until the new guy took over full-time. There\\'s been no direction. And since our old boss was truly an amazing human who could lead us and keep open communication to superiors transparent ... when she left, we no longer seemed to matter because we lost our champion. We\\'re supposed to go back into the office in a few weeks.\\n\\nThe past year and a half we were told to go home and make space in our lives for a work area. We set up our offices, we worked through logistics and used our own internet service; we conformed and respected it. It was not seamless, but we made it work and for many of us, it was an eye-opening experience. No commute, no uncomfortable work clothes, no having to stay in one spot. The ability to spend more time with our families, to load the washing machine on our lunch break, to take our laptop outside on beautiful days, to be ourselves, to enjoy our homes, to work in a comfortable and safe environment. I have actually been able to cook breakfast, lunch and dinner almost daily for my family and it has been incredible.\\n\\nWhen I was hired, I remember specifically during orientation it was stressed to us how much they cared about the work-life balance and how remote working and flexibility were options in almost every position. Unfortunately, beyond the ability to adjust start/end times by an hour, I never felt those options up until pandemic times … but now I see that nothing has really changed, at least in our area. I have valued life more in the past year and a half than I have in a long time. But being forced back into an office for 8 hours a day makes me feel like my life is not valued by the place I give a lot of it to daily. I have cried, I have stressed so much my sleep and the quality of day-to-day living has suffered, I have spent about $300 to try to find clothes that are “professional” enough (even though I only see my co-workers and don’t have clients or anything like that daily ... I\\'m still required to dress like I do) yet provide some level of comfort like what I’ve been used to wearing, I have reached out for help in my network and found that there are many others in the same boat who have found or are in the process of finding remote options that SO many businesses have embraced. I have looked into EAP options, as well, because I know my mental health is suffering right now. It seems silly, but I am grieving my life from the last year and a half. I have been more productive, safer and ultimately happier at home. All of my responsibilities can be completed remotely, aside from when we have in-person experiences that require my assistance (and I am more than happy to help out as needed, but will always mask up and keep my distance as much as possible in those situations).\\n\\nI had pneumonia in 2019 and legit almost died. I have lung damage and have been encouraged by HR to pursue ADA options, but it feels like then I\\'ll be the \"problem\" and will be eliminated. I could be wrong. I hope I\\'d be wrong. Just scared. I feel like I\\'d be singled out.\\n\\nI went into my office this afternoon after hours. I had cards on my board from my old boss. A gift from my coworker who had passed. Reminders of old projects. A coloring page I had hung on my wall in 2020 where each month is block letters divided into spaces for each day of the month. I\\'d colored to March 15 and no more. It felt like visiting a tomb.

My company was also ill equipped to wfh, a little behind the times. During lock down we worked from home for about 5 months returning in July to the office. When we went back initially it was Monday-Thursday. But now we go to the office 3 days a week, and those days are optional for some of the staff if there are no meetings, this does not apply to me though. My manager said we will be back 5 days a week again soon. Unfortunately it took me getting Covid at the office for my manager to even let us wfh part time. I'm really not happy about returning to a 5 day work week because wfh at least 1 day a week has been so beneficial to my work life balance. I like a mix of both, being at the office and at home. I think office workers deserve 1 day a week to wfh if they want. Not having to commute just one day allows me to get so much done in my personal life that I would otherwise have to do on a Saturday. Not to mention I am more well rested and productive at the office. There is nothing worse than being at work and you are overly exhausted or don't have a project. Those empty hours could be spent at home.\\n\\nAnyway, I've noticed when I wfh I am more productive with my detailed/research projects. I am able to hyper focus at home. I can get more things done in a shorter amount of time vs. the office. This unfortunately allows me to procrastinate more than I should. My problem I have been struggling with lately is that when I am at home I tend to work better at night. Or I like to log on over the weekend and work. So during the work day I turn my computer on at 9:30 and am logged on until 5:30 for any urgent issues. I always meet all of my deadlines, but have been finding it difficult to spend that 9:30-5:30 time at home actually working. I feel pretty guilty about it and it makes me a little depressed. I was wondering if anyone shared this feeling and could offer their thoughts and strategies on it. \\n\\nThanks for reading.\",\n",

The only snag I can think of, and there's probably something obvious I'm overlooking, is what happens when I need to be in a meeting where everyone but me is in the office. Our conference rooms have video and all, but our offices don't and smaller meetings (like maybe 5 people) often take place in offices. Do I Zoom in on one person's laptop? Rely on speakerphone (please no)?

       " 'Some tips on how to stay productive and healthy while working from home! Hey everyone,  \\n\\n\\nI was working in the live entertainment industry for nearly a decade, which got totally whooped when covid hit. Since then, I\\'ve gone from a life on the road to starting a localized seo business - and staying productive has been one hell of a learning process. When I started I was putting in 40-50 rather unproductive hours a week, but now I can usually finish everything I need in 25-35 hours.   \\n\\n\\nFigured I\\'d share a few tips I\\'ve learned from starting a business and working a semi-normal work from home schedule. Staying motivated is always a challenge, but I believe I\\'ve come a long way. The trick is you just gotta keep trying - and understand that no one is 100% productive all the time.\\n\\n&amp;#x200B;\\n\\n1. **Have a separate work-only station**\\n   1. I\\'m a musician at heart, so when I started my business I was doing it from my studio workstation (which also has games installed). Would find myself getting distracted by a guitar, or music software, or world of warcraft... stuff like that. I ended up clearing out a spare room in my house, dressed it up aesthetically, and put in a small desk with a laptop that was totally dedicated to work. It has helped immensely. Sets the stage for a productive, \"it\\'s time to work now\" mindset.\\n   2. Make your working area look nice, too. I try to keep mine as clean as possible and since I don\\'t have a window in the room, I\\'ve added a UV light and a bunch of plants. I put a tower for my cat to hang out with me, a small fish tank, and have covered the walls in art. \\n2. **Try your absolute best to stick to your schedule**\\n   1. Time spent alone is more productive if it\\'s structured. Sounds pretty obvious - and it is always a fight to maintain - but wake up and go to bed at the same time. Try your best to stop working at 5pm, or whatever works for you.\\n   2. Include breaks, too. I usually give myself 10 minutes for every hour of work.\\n   3. If you struggle to get up, brew a pot of coffee before bed and put it in a thermos. Place it right next to your bed and when you wake up, take big gulp. If you do it at the same time for a few days in a row, you\\'ll stop needing to drink the coffee. \\n3. **Move your body**\\n   1. I love my standing desk and use it constantly. Will generally stand for a third of the day. I also notice that standing makes me a bit more alert and engaged for calls and meetings with clients\\n   2. I put a yoga mat in the room and will usually try to do small, quick reps of squats and pushups throughout the day. Nothing crazy, but just enough to get the blood flowing\\n   3. I also try to take a 10-15 minute walk everyday, usually after lunch time with my kids!\\n4. **Communicate with your buds**\\n   1. In localized seo, we use blog networks with other SEOs to help rank our sites. I have made some really good buddies doing this and we have some facebook and discord groups to keep in touch. Sure, it can be a bit distracting at times, but it\\'s really nice to have people to chat with during the day. I\\'m sure you can do the same with your co-workers. Guess what I\\'m trying to say is that it\\'s okay to be social, even if it means being a little less productive, because humans are meant to be social.\\n   2. That being said, never shy away from a video call. I think people feel more comfortable emailing and chatting, but I always find my best calls are the ones where I can see the faces of my clients and partners. \\n5. **Have lunch with your family/house mates**\\n   1. While my wife is an essential worker, my kids are still at home. I always make a point to enjoy lunch with them. You can do the same with whoever you live with.\\n6. **Being comfortable** **is worth it**\\n   1. Don\\'t skimp on your chair, or the things you use constantly every day.\\n   2. The same goes for your desk. Get something that makes you look forward to using.\\n   3. Hell, if you can afford, buy a nice mechanical keyboard. They\\'re so much better than normal keyboards. \\n7. **Use lists**\\n   1. I always start my day with writing down the most important things I need to get done with a few sub tasks under that.\\n      1. If I finish everything on my list, then I\\'m done for the day.\\n8. **Still dress up for work**\\n   1. I still wake up and take a shower, shave, ect... and also try to put on somewhat normal clothes. Just gets me in the mindset to work and helps me maintain my routine.\\n9. **Play music**\\n   1. **...**if it\\'s not distracting to you. I usually listen to super ambient stuff, like Tycho or Helios. Spotify has a ton of great ambient soundtracks. If my kids are being loud, sometimes I\\'ll just throw on some brown/white noise or rain sounds. \\n   2. Also, sound cancelling headphones are awesome if you don\\'t have a separate work station.\\n10. **Be grateful you get to work from home**\\n   1. Before I started my business and even tour managing, I worked in a office. I hated it and knew it wasn\\'t the life I wanted to live. When I\\'m feeling super unmotivated I try to think back to how I felt at my first out of college job - and I try to be thankful that I currently have the freedom to work in an environment that I much prefer. \\n\\nLosing my tour managing career to COVID was awful - and feeling like I needed to conform to the 9-5 grind didn\\'t help at all. I took a massive leap of faith in starting my seo business. But hey, things are finally working out and if things keep going well, I can probably go back to tour management when things go back to normal. That being said, I hope your own work situation is going well - and I hope that my tips have been useful! Have a great day and thank you for reading :)',\n",

       " \"Extraverted boss wants me back in the office. How do I tell her no? I work for a very small company (less than 20 people). For the last two years, I've been allowed to WFH the majority of the time. It's been amazing for my overall mood and productivity and I love the flexibility it brings to my day. I'm very introverted and find the office environment to be draining and distracting. I've had to go into the office for about 2-3 months last year (some of that was hybrid). I was told that I needed to be there in case they needed help with clients (never happened). My office was upstairs in a corner where I was mostly left alone since no one else up there was back in the office yet. My boss informed me this week that I'll be coming back into the office next week for at least the next month and then maybe they'll think about letting me work from home a day or two a week (unlikely). Unlike last time, my office got moved downstairs so I can help out with clients, since we are going to be short a receptionist. Plus almost everyone will be back in the office, so the noise levels and interruptions will increase. We are starting up in-person client meetings and the head boss doesn't want us to use the bathroom during those times. There could be meetings anywhere from 2 to 6 hours a day! I'm so miserable at the idea of going back. I plan on job searching, but I would really appreciate any ideas on how to tell my boss that coming back into the office is untenable. When she talked to me there was no room for my feedback, as though her mind was made up even though she knows I adamantly want to WFH. Any suggestions?\",\n",

       " \"Work from Home Manifesto I have worked the last 2 years at home, having just started a new position before going home for COVID. This has been the best 2 years of my life. Being able to spend this much time with my family and seeing my kids grow up. I wouldn’t trade it for the world. Going back to the office was always inevitable. My company has never changed their tune, and I understand their opinion and decision. My company hasn’t changed, but I have. I have changed opinion not only because of my family, but I’ve also changed my opinion on what is the most effective way to do my job. Not only have I enjoyed working from home to be around my family, I have been able to focus more on my work. I have developed more, I have learned more, and I am more effective on a daily basis. More than I can be driving into the office.\\n\\nI know some have a different opinion that there is an invaluable experience in working in an office and collaborating with others. I personally don’t know if I believe this or not. I don’t know if I’d have the skills I have today, having worked in an office for this long. Maybe I wouldn’t have learned and grown as much. Or maybe like the last 2 years, I would have learned and grown faster. I do know that the majority of people saying you need to be in the office, also have power over people in the office and they have the biggest desks, and offices with doors. Maybe they’ve spent so much time and energy acquiring this office stature that they don’t want to lose that?\\n\\nI know some are saying just suck it up and be a man, or woman. Be a man, or woman, and just drive into work. I believe a man, or woman, should suck it up and go to work, and provide for their family. The question is what does your job entail? Are you driving to work in a cubicle farm because you think that’s the profitable thing for the company? If you’re like me and believe you're more profitable for the company when you’re working from home, then you’re just driving to the cubicle farm for your boss. You are being your boss’ bitch. Then you’re going around calling others childish.\\n\\nIn conclusion I’ve poured a lot of time and effort into doing a great job for my company the last 2 years. Now I feel like I’m asked to drive in (take a pay cut). Give up time at home. And perform my job less effectively. Who’s winning? The person in the big office probably sleeps better, I hope the power trip improves their sex too.\",\n",

I have a meeting with my boss fortnightly, so I was consdiering bring up then, but just not sure how to ask for a permanent 1 or 2 days WFH each week? So any advice would be great! Also, I'm not sure how many days WFH I could get away with, I know they would likely say ok after some thinking to 1 day a week, but I know I'm unlikely to get this opportunity to tweak my working hours again. So, is it best to play it safe and ask for 1 WFH day a week, or try ask for 1 or 2 and see if they would take me up on 2 WFH days?\",\n",

       " 'Just got hired at a company paying me $32/hr after completely &amp; utterly lying on every aspect of my resume I’m 26 and have worked absolutely nothing but labor jobs for probably the past 7 years. From landscaping, fencing, roofing, to repairing &amp; restoring tennis &amp; basketball courts. \\n\\nI was introduced to WFH through my ex last year. We had started spending a lot of time together and she was over a lot so it was only convenient for her to start working from home at my place. Some call center insurance thing, I’m not really sure. Point is, even though I’ve always known of WFH jobs existing, especially with them popping up a lot more during the pandemic, I never for a second considered I could ever find a decent position at a place I’d want to work that would pay me what doing labor work was. I mean while it’s nice to sit home all day and not sweat in the summer heat, my ex was only making like 15-16/hr while I was doing 22. I mean the difference is negligible but it was enough for me to keep the ideations of leaving my job in the back of my head… until three weeks ago. \\n\\nWe have these times off around this season as it starts to get to cold to work with paint on tennis courts, so instead we’re put on unemployment and told to come back around spring. Most of the guys I work with simply go back to their home countries during this time (el salvador mostly) or hunker down collecting unemployment while doing minimal under the table work in the meantime. It’s not a bad deal tbh, 400 a week plus whatever you make under the table. \\n\\nTrouble for me was, I lost my car 2 weeks ago. That halted any traveling I could do to make money in the meantime while also collecting unemployment. And so these ideations came circling back around. \\n\\nThe problem as I saw it was, my resume consisted of nothing that would even remotely reflect I would perform well at a call center. I mean I’ve never even been to college. So what do I do? I go to r/resumes and scour the bunch for something I can use that would reflect well to potential WFH employers. I don’t straight up steal someone’s resume, what I did is pick &amp; choose from multiple people’s descriptions of their jobs, people’s accolades/achievements, even goddamn degrees &amp; certificates. \\n\\nThen I went on indeed and probably applied to about 20 places in the span of like 30 minutes. It was about midnight I was doing this. I wake up the next morning to a text at 8:39am asking if I’m me. I say yes and this is the copy &amp; pasted reply I get, names changed. \\n\\n“I’m Mr. Bean from Big Bean. Your resume has been reviewed for the position of a Customer Services Representative, we would like to invite you to an interview and we pay nothing less than $30 hourly, Kindly reply if you are still interested for more info. Thank you!” \\n\\nLong story short (I know I just told the entire story, please forgive me I am black this is what we do) we go through the interview process and I absolutely crush it because I’m really good with words (it was a text interview through Wire). I was extremely skeptical the entire time thinking I was being scammed, waiting for the ball to drop where I’m asked to send in a photo id with ssn or something along those lines. But no, it was a fairly typical interview, took about an hour, and I was told I impressed the interviewer and his superiors. They promptly sent me an offer letter &amp; w-4 form which I signed &amp; sent back.\\n\\nMind you, this isn’t the first time I’ve lied to get a job. Hell, it’s not even close to the most egregious lie to get a job I’ve done. But it’s insane to me that I could still lie for this level of income. \\n\\nTL;DR: title',\n",

At the beginning of the pandemic, our incredible boss found a new job and we inherited a boss from another office (job was supposed to be advertised ... hasn\\'t been yet and his old position was eliminated and I was directed to remove the word \"interim\" from his title on our website so ... ). After 3 months of being home during the pandemic, one of our team members died (cancer). We are a small team of 8 (now 7). We transitioned well to working from home and went full steam ahead until the new guy took over full-time. There\\'s been no direction. And since our old boss was truly an amazing human who could lead us and keep open communication to superiors transparent ... when she left, we no longer seemed to matter because we lost our champion. We\\'re supposed to go back into the office in a few weeks.\\n\\nThe past year and a half we were told to go home and make space in our lives for a work area. We set up our offices, we worked through logistics and used our own internet service; we conformed and respected it. It was not seamless, but we made it work and for many of us, it was an eye-opening experience. No commute, no uncomfortable work clothes, no having to stay in one spot. The ability to spend more time with our families, to load the washing machine on our lunch break, to take our laptop outside on beautiful days, to be ourselves, to enjoy our homes, to work in a comfortable and safe environment. I have actually been able to cook breakfast, lunch and dinner almost daily for my family and it has been incredible.\\n\\nWhen I was hired, I remember specifically during orientation it was stressed to us how much they cared about the work-life balance and how remote working and flexibility were options in almost every position. Unfortunately, beyond the ability to adjust start/end times by an hour, I never felt those options up until pandemic times … but now I see that nothing has really changed, at least in our area. I have valued life more in the past year and a half than I have in a long time. But being forced back into an office for 8 hours a day makes me feel like my life is not valued by the place I give a lot of it to daily. I have cried, I have stressed so much my sleep and the quality of day-to-day living has suffered, I have spent about $300 to try to find clothes that are “professional” enough (even though I only see my co-workers and don’t have clients or anything like that daily ... I\\'m still required to dress like I do) yet provide some level of comfort like what I’ve been used to wearing, I have reached out for help in my network and found that there are many others in the same boat who have found or are in the process of finding remote options that SO many businesses have embraced. I have looked into EAP options, as well, because I know my mental health is suffering right now. It seems silly, but I am grieving my life from the last year and a half. I have been more productive, safer and ultimately happier at home.

Throughout this period we have been the busiest we have ever have been in the history of the company and acheived record sales turnover (at least double our previous annual turnover) - all whilst we have been working from home full time.\\n\\nMy Directors have contacted me saying they want me to put a plan together to bring all the sales team back to the office on a full time basis i.e. no longer working from home.  I expressed that I would like them to consider flexibibly of working from home and office e.g. 3 days working from home and 2 days in the office.  They are reluctant because \"I\\'m the manager and its expected of me to be in the office full time\".\\n\\nMy main reasons for flexible working are:\\n\\n\\\\- Inflation and there are no signifacant pay rises are about to be introduced from the company\\n\\n\\\\- I have saved considerable amounts of money on transportation (fuel) costs.\\n\\n\\\\- The atmosphere is horrible and negative in the office\\n\\n\\\\- I\\'ve become more productive when working from home with less interruptions (we have an open office at the company)\\n\\n\\\\- I can conduct private managerial matters which I can\\'t conduct in an open office\\n\\n\\\\- I\\'ve become far more mentally positive working from home\\n\\n&amp;#x200B;\\n\\nDespite the remote systems I have put in place since March 2020 in order for us to be very effecient and productive, the only reason they want us back in the office is because they are the micro-mangement style of directors.

       " \"Doing the math on commutes A lot of companies are pushing employees to come back to the office, so I thought it would be good to provide some hard numbers on what a commute actually costs in terms of both time and money.\\n\\nAccording to the [US Census Bureau](https://www.census.gov/newsroom/press-releases/2021/one-way-travel-time-to-work-rises.html), the average American commute is 27.6 minutes long.

Using that amount and the average commute distance, the cost of the average commute is:\\n\\n      16 miles each way\\n    x 2 times a day\\n    x 5 days per week\\n    x 50 working weeks per year \\n    x $0.56 per mile\\n    --------------------------------\\n    $4,480 per year\\n\\nSo for the average American, eliminating a commute is the equivalent of getting **a $4,500 raise and two weeks off.** This is an intentionally conservative estimate, and doesn't take into account things like:\\n\\n - Parking costs\\n - Public transit costs\\n - Worker time costs\\n - Cost of office space\\n\\nNot to mention all of the hard-to-quantify things like mental health, location flexibility, and improved productivity. \\n\\nSo when you're looking for a WFH job it might make sense to accept lower pay if your boss is making go back to your very long commute.\",\n",

       " 'WFH but deducting travel commute question TLDR; what are your thoughts or experiences on working a mostly remote job but having to deduct a home-to-office travel commute due to company policy if you travel locally for work purposes at times?\\n\\nI live in Sacramento, CA and started working a new job in January of this year and it\\'s remote/field work, as there is no specific office space allocated for my coworkers or myself in our specific department (the 2 managers share an office) at any of the company locations. If I\\'d had to guess I\\'d say I\\'m working from home about 75% of the time and visiting with clients the other 25%; I have no obligation or reason to visit the office unless I want to print a bunch of stuff and don\\'t want to waste my ink at home. Our meetings and trainings are virtual 99% of the time (we\\'ve met twice at a park before).\\n\\nWe have access to several offices but only one is delegated as our \"home office\". This is a problem for me and I\\'ll explain why below. \\n\\nFor our expense report we are required to deduct a one way commute if we visit our home office while in the field, or a round trip commute if we never visit the office and do field work. \\n\\nMy problem is, the home office is 16.4 miles away from my home one way. If I\\'m in the field and never visit the office that\\'s 32.8 miles shaved off my travel time with clients, etc. so often times I\\'m only getting reimbursed $2-$3 for traveling 38 miles for example. \\n\\nAnother office is about 6 miles away and I\\'d feel better deducting that commute because I actually do visit that office much more, although it\\'s not my \"home\" office.\\n\\nI honestly feel like we shouldn\\'t have to deduct a commute at all since we aren\\'t required to visit the office anyway. I asked employees that have been at the company pre-covid if things have changed and they say that it\\'s pretty much the same, there were more in person meetings but they expected our department to be in the field 90% of the time except for meetings, etc.\\n\\n I feel like we\\'re being slighted and I\\'m going to complete my expense report the way *I* feel like it should be and see if my boss will address it with me so I can tell her all of this. \\n\\nWhat are your thoughts on this, is this right or legal?

       " \"WFH rant/productivity challenges - can anyone relate I've never been a morning person, literally my entire life. I don't think that will change. I'm 30 years old now and still naturally wake up at 10 am and go to sleep at 2 am. (I have tried to change) But I have ADD and this year has ruined any routine I have ever had.  \\n\\nI hated wfh full time when lock down first started. My company was also ill equipped to wfh, a little behind the times. During lock down we worked from home for about 5 months returning in July to the office. When we went back initially it was Monday-Thursday. But now we go to the office 3 days a week, and those days are optional for some of the staff if there are no meetings, this does not apply to me though. My manager said we will be back 5 days a week again soon. Unfortunately it took me getting Covid at the office for my manager to even let us wfh part time. I'm really not happy about returning to a 5 day work week because wfh at least 1 day a week has been so beneficial to my work life balance. I like a mix of both, being at the office and at home. I think office workers deserve 1 day a week to wfh if they want. Not having to commute just one day allows me to get so much done in my personal life that I would otherwise have to do on a Saturday. Not to mention I am more well rested and productive at the office. There is nothing worse than being at work and you are overly exhausted or don't have a project. Those empty hours could be spent at home.\\n\\nAnyway, I've noticed when I wfh I am more productive with my detailed/research projects. I am able to hyper focus at home. I can get more things done in a shorter amount of time vs. the office. This unfortunately allows me to procrastinate more than I should. My problem I have been struggling with lately is that when I am at home I tend to work better at night. Or I like to log on over the weekend and work. So during the work day I turn my computer on at 9:30 and am logged on until 5:30 for any urgent issues.

       " 'Some tips on how to stay productive and healthy while working from home! Hey everyone,  \\n\\n\\nI was working in the live entertainment industry for nearly a decade, which got totally whooped when covid hit. Since then, I\\'ve gone from a life on the road to starting a localized seo business - and staying productive has been one hell of a learning process. When I started I was putting in 40-50 rather unproductive hours a week, but now I can usually finish everything I need in 25-35 hours.   \\n\\n\\nFigured I\\'d share a few tips I\\'ve learned from starting a business and working a semi-normal work from home schedule. Staying motivated is always a challenge, but I believe I\\'ve come a long way. The trick is you just gotta keep trying - and understand that no one is 100% productive all the time.\\n\\n&amp;#x200B;\\n\\n1. **Have a separate work-only station**\\n   1. I\\'m a musician at heart, so when I started my business I was doing it from my studio workstation (which also has games installed). Would find myself getting distracted by a guitar, or music software, or world of warcraft... stuff like that. I ended up clearing out a spare room in my house, dressed it up aesthetically, and put in a small desk with a laptop that was totally dedicated to work. It has helped immensely. Sets the stage for a productive, \"it\\'s time to work now\" mindset.\\n   2. Make your working area look nice, too. I try to keep mine as clean as possible and since I don\\'t have a window in the room, I\\'ve added a UV light and a bunch of plants. I put a tower for my cat to hang out with me, a small fish tank, and have covered the walls in art. \\n2. **Try your absolute best to stick to your schedule**\\n   1. Time spent alone is more productive if it\\'s structured. Sounds pretty obvious - and it is always a fight to maintain - but wake up and go to bed at the same time. Try your best to stop working at 5pm, or whatever works for you.\\n   2. Include breaks, too. I usually give myself 10 minutes for every hour of work.\\n   3. If you struggle to get up, brew a pot of coffee before bed and put it in a thermos. Place it right next to your bed and when you wake up, take big gulp. If you do it at the same time for a few days in a row, you\\'ll stop needing to drink the coffee. \\n3. **Move your body**\\n   1. I love my standing desk and use it constantly. Will generally stand for a third of the day. I also notice that standing makes me a bit more alert and engaged for calls and meetings with clients\\n   2. I put a yoga mat in the room and will usually try to do small, quick reps of squats and pushups throughout the day. Nothing crazy, but just enough to get the blood flowing\\n   3. I also try to take a 10-15 minute walk everyday, usually after lunch time with my kids!\\n4. **Communicate with your buds**\\n   1. In localized seo, we use blog networks with other SEOs to help rank our sites. I have made some really good buddies doing this and we have some facebook and discord groups to keep in touch. Sure, it can be a bit distracting at times, but it\\'s really nice to have people to chat with during the day. I\\'m sure you can do the same with your co-workers. Guess what I\\'m trying to say is that it\\'s okay to be social, even if it means being a little less productive, because humans are meant to be social.\\n   2. That being said, never shy away from a video call. I think people feel more comfortable emailing and chatting, but I always find my best calls are the ones where I can see the faces of my clients and partners. \\n5. **Have lunch with your family/house mates**\\n   1. While my wife is an essential worker, my kids are still at home. I always make a point to enjoy lunch with them. You can do the same with whoever you live with.\\n6. **Being comfortable** **is worth it**\\n   1. Don\\'t skimp on your chair, or the things you use constantly every day.\\n   2. The same goes for your desk. Get something that makes you look forward to using.\\n   3. Hell, if you can afford, buy a nice mechanical keyboard. They\\'re so much better than normal keyboards. \\n7. **Use lists**\\n   1. I always start my day with writing down the most important things I need to get done with a few sub tasks under that.\\n      1. If I finish everything on my list, then I\\'m done for the day.\\n8. **Still dress up for work**\\n   1. I still wake up and take a shower, shave, ect... and also try to put on somewhat normal clothes. Just gets me in the mindset to work and helps me maintain my routine.\\n9. **Play music**\\n   1. **...**if it\\'s not distracting to you. I usually listen to super ambient stuff, like Tycho or Helios. Spotify has a ton of great ambient soundtracks. If my kids are being loud, sometimes I\\'ll just throw on some brown/white noise or rain sounds. \\n   2. Also, sound cancelling headphones are awesome if you don\\'t have a separate work station.\\n10. **Be grateful you get to work from home**\\n   1. Before I started my business and even tour managing, I worked in a office. I hated it and knew it wasn\\'t the life I wanted to live. When I\\'m feeling super unmotivated I try to think back to how I felt at my first out of college job - and I try to be thankful that I currently have the freedom to work in an environment that I much prefer. \\n\\nLosing my tour managing career to COVID was awful - and feeling like I needed to conform to the 9-5 grind didn\\'t help at all. I took a massive leap of faith in starting my seo business. But hey, things are finally working out and if things keep going well, I can probably go back to tour management when things go back to normal. That being said, I hope your own work situation is going well - and I hope that my tips have been useful! Have a great day and thank you for reading :)',\n",

It’s an outdoor space that is adapted into an area suited to work from home. Backyard sheds are serving the needs of people who are working from home and are in desperate search for a way to avoid clashing with other family members who are also working or studying from home.\\n\\nLocating your office in the backyard is not a newly-emerging concept. However, in 2020 it was the COVID-19 situation that transformed the backyard office into an established trend.\\n\\nFurthermore, shed companies are now giving people tons of options and opportunities to design, furnish and customize their sheds however they want to. Now, the backyard office is not just a way to distance your professional life from your home/personal life but it’s also a great way to work in a place that’s been entirely created based on your own personal taste, needs and comfort.\\n\\n**Increase in Sales of Sheds**\\n\\nShed companies, especially from the U.S.A., have reported a significant increase in sales. Business is booming as shed manufacturers have focused on fulfilling every need, ranging from compact home office structures to deluxe or more elaborate custom designs. LA-based manufacturers, for instance, have reported that sales for prefab backyard offices have increased by 250&amp; since mid-April\\n\\nHumble sheds are no longer wanted. Companies are designing complex structures and focusing on functionalities by adding features like operable windows, solar panels for power and more.\\n\\nOf course, the classic cottages are still here to stay. However, these days people who work from home invest in more modern-looking sheds that mimic small house designs.\\n\\nIn terms of investment, a typical prefab backyard office can cost you between $10k-$30k. Of course, the price depends on features such as plumbing, smart office equipment, windows, solar panels and more. Moreover, what you should also keep in mind is the need and cost for a building permit, which also varies depending on your location and the size of the shed.\\n\\nMany work-from-home people think that this is just a small price to pay for ensuring convenience, peace and quiet while focusing on work and performing their daily job responsibilities.\\n\\n**What are the advantages of the backyard office?**\\n\\nI’ve briefly touched upon several of those advantages, the main one being that an outdoor office shed provides a personal space and a clear separation between life and work, while you’re still technically in your own home. **What are some other benefits of having a backyard home office?**\\n\\n* **It’s not that expensive to do it.** If you want to remodel your house and add another room, it will cost you a lot of time and money. Buying a shed, however, is affordable and just as good of a solution to your problems with personal work space.\\n* **All the** [**work-from-home benefits**](https://velinablogging.medium.com/working-from-home-stresses-you-out-5b67f3b17482) **are still kept**. Some of those include flexible schedules, no travelling and being closer to your loved ones.\\n* **There are plenty of backyard office solutions out there to choose from.** You can design your outdoor office the way you’ve always imagined! Wooden exterior, sliding doors, energy-efficient windows, solar power packages controlled with your smartphone or Alexa are just a very few of the options you have for your backyard shed. Not just that but now you can bring back the inner decorator in you and furnish it the way you want to.\\n* **It doesn’t take that long to build it.** Depending on the type of shed you purchase, it may take from 2 days to 2 weeks but no more. This is nothing compared to the time it will take you to add another room to your house.  \\nFrom ordering a prefabricated structure to having your first Zoom team meeting will take you less than a week.\\n* **You can enjoy fresh air and natural light.** This is something we rarely think about when we used to work in the office. Now, you can customize your backyard office studio with sliding doors or plenty of windows you can open at any time. There’s nothing better than working outside and getting a good dose of vitamin D.\\n* **Everyone can benefit from having their own backyard office, regardless of their occupation.** Whether you’re a businessman, a marketing manager or a writer or artist, you can only benefit from investing in a personal outdoor office or studio.\\n* **Your new backyard office shed can be made from sustainable elements** and you can utilize solar panels or renewable energy generators to keep the project as green as possible.\\n* **Multipurpose!** Think about that. An office shed can be where you work throughout the day but it can be so much more than that when you’re finished with your work. You will equip the shed with a computer, probably a TV and you can even add a bed. It can become the perfect place where you and your children can play video games. Not just that but if you include a bed or a gold out couch in it, it can also turn into a guest room when required.\\n* **No noise pollution.** You will immediately spot the difference. If your office used to be located in a busy city area with vehicles driving past each other and people talking or shouting all over the place, you were probably feeling quite stressed about it. Now, you can escape into your shed and enjoy peace and quiet while you’re coming up with the next big business idea!\\n* **An office shed located in your backyard can increase your home’s value.** This is something that you’re not thinking about right now but one day, your outside office can increase the value of your house as much as 5–7% if it’s in a good state. Your investment now will surely bring you profit one day when you decide to move somewhere else and sell your house.\\n\\n**Final thoughts**\\n\\nWorking from home is here to stay. Even without the COVID-19 pandemic, there are a huge number of people who have been practicing remote work for years now. That’s why designating a specific area where you can focus on work has become increasingly important.\\n\\nA backyard office or studio is definitely a great solution to your problems. If things get too cramped inside the house, it’s definitely a wise decision to invest in a shed. Cheap backyard office sheds are offered by many companies these days. You can also design it the way you’ve always imagined your office would look like. You want a soundproofed room or an office space where you can blast your music while working on your next project? You can have it all!\\n\\nBuilding comfort for yourself and your career will ultimately help you grow as a professional. That new level of relaxation and solitude is directly tied to improved efficiency and productivity. Now, all you have to do is check shed manufacturers near you and start preparing for your new office!\\n\\n&amp;#x200B;\\n\\nSource: [RIP, Office!

       " 'How to Stay Productive While Working From Home I wrote this as an article and thought to post this here too. What tips do you use to stay productive while working from home? \\n\\n\\\\----\\n\\n# How to Stay Productive While Working From Home\\n\\nWorking from home can be a dream. It can also be very challenging. Since the world seems to be adopting a work from home mindset, I wanted to share some tips on how to stay productive while working from home that I have found helpful over the years.\\n\\n## Take Time to Prepare\\n\\nWhen working from home, you must prepare for the day ahead. You don’t want to be caught like a deer in headlights when your alarm clock rings. Think about it. You are working from ‘home.’ Your home is a place of rest, relaxation, and distractions. Generally speaking, a home is not a place designed for maximum deep work and productivity – it’s a jungle.\\n\\nNow that we have established that our homes are a minefield of personal and professional obstacles, it is easy to see why having a plan going into your day is so important.\\n\\n### Start planning a day in advance\\n\\nTake some time at the end of your workday. Look through the tasks of the day and check off everything that you have accomplished. Now it’s time to make a new list. Write down a list of everything that you would like to do tomorrow. Make sure to include any tasks that you didn’t get around to during the day.\\n\\nWith your list more or less completed, take a moment and think about what your day is going to looks like tomorrow. If you’d like, you can stack this process with another good habit of cleaning your desk (more on this in the next step). While thinking about the next day, you may find you need to consult with a team lead or partner. Check-in with them to see if there is anything that they might require you to do. Maybe you need to run an errand for a spouse, meet with a potential client, or start dinner a little earlier. You should have a compiled list of tasks at this point, and already a clearer picture of what the next day would look like.\\n\\n### Grab the Calender\\n\\nTake your list and sit down with your calendar. At this point, you want to try to visualize your day as best as possible. This process is not supposed to be perfect, but rather a rough outline of your day. Try to be realistic with the time it takes to complete tasks. Give yourself some leeway, and don’t expect a robot-like performance from yourself. Again, be realistic.\\n\\n&amp;#x200B;\\n\\n## Develop a Routine\\n\\nSimilar to planning your day, a routine is there to help define boundaries for your home and office. Do you remember a time when you worked a job at an office? Chances are you had to be out of bed at a specific time; you performed a particular set of tasks to get ready and have some commute before arriving to work. While those things may have seemed like a drag at the time, they were helping you to get available for work.\\n\\nOnce we get into the flow of a routine, often, it may seem like we are in auto-pilot mode. Slowly drifting along until arriving at our destination. A routine helps prime your brain and body for the next event. Once a set of tasks are completed, like waking up, brushing your teeth, and driving to work, your brain is ready to do the next event – usually, work.\\n\\nBecause we work from home, you might find it a bit difficult to have a set routine. Each day is different because we are privileged (and cursed) enough to have flexibility. If you just roll out of bed and open your laptop on Monday, but only start working in the afternoon on Tuesday, you might have a difficult time trying to focus or getting in the zone when it’s time to work.\\n\\n### Start-Up Routine\\n\\nTry to set up a simple start-up routine to get into the swing of things. You have the freedom to set this routine and start at any time that best suits you. A start-up routine doesn’t have to be time-consuming, complex, and cumbersome.\\n\\nI am currently trying a simple routine. When I am ready to start work (which is usually more or less the same time every morning), I head out the front door for a quick 10-minute walk around my neighborhood. When I get back home, I put on some coffee and wait for it to brew while casually browsing my phone. After the coffee is ready, I pour a cup for myself and my wife and head to the office. As you can see, this is almost mimicking a commute along with grabbing a coffee before sitting down to work. I find that a 10-minute break to be alone and outside helps re-align my thoughts. It also adds some distance from myself and my home. It allows me to refresh my brain, ready to take on the workday ahead.\\n\\n### Shutdown Routine\\n\\nSimilar to the start-up routine, the shutdown routine happens at the end of your day. When you’re ready to “Pack up” and go home, I’ll admit, some days, I rush out my home office and into the kitchen. But ideally, I like to first close all my browser tabs and apps on my computer. Start making a list of to-do’s for the next day, and clean my desk. If I am feeling like a groggy-zombie, I like heading outside to get some fresh air or take a quick walk around the block to clear my head.\\n\\nWhen I get back home, my brain has been reset and I am ready to spend time with my family.\\n\\n## Take a Breather\\n\\nHave you ever had a friend jealously ask you about your workday? Maybe they begrudgingly scuff at the thought of you doing an hour of work while the rest of your day is spent lounging around?\\n\\nThis could not be farther from the truth, at least in my experience. As a remote worker, I find it incredibly easy to sit in front of my computer for a copious amount of hours at a time – not a good idea.\\n\\nTry taking regular breaks. While this may sound easy, it is pretty tricky to put into practice. Frequent breaks are essential to staying productive while working at home. Your body needs it, and you might find that you perform better by taking these small but frequent breathers—bonus points for having your break outside.\\n\\n## Work to Your Strengths.\\n\\nThe beauty of working from home is that you have the power of flexibility at your disposal. Mostly, as long as you can get your work done promptly, companies don’t mind when and how you get your job done.\\n\\nIf you’re an early bird, go ahead and get started nice and early. Prefer to take on your tasks like a cape crusader in the night? Why not? You might need to clarify this with your team leader, but if they say it’s all good, you’re ready to roll – whatever time suits you best.\\n\\nI prefer to work later in the day or even at night. My family dynamics, however, have me working closer to a standard 9 to 5 office hours kind of deal.\\n\\nWork to your strengths. You have the power to leverage your natural productive abilities when you feel most productive.\\n\\n## Try Journaling\\n\\nI would love to be more consistent in this regard, but I find journalling a great tool to stay productive while working from home. Journaling no matter how simple is fantastic at developing one’s self-awareness muscles. This self-awareness comes in handy when you need to realign a routine. Speak up in a meeting or know when to take a break (or push a little bit harder).\\n\\n### Bullet Journal\\n\\nI use a simple Bullet Journal method that helps me record my day’s tasks, organize my thoughts, and take note of new ideas. My bullet journal is also my anchor. If I am working, it is right by my side, ready to be flipped through and scribbled in at a moment’s notice.\\n\\nThere are a lot of different journaling methods that can boost productivity, creativity, and personal development. I use the Bullet Journal system, but I’d encourage you to find a journaling method that best suits you.\\n\\n**Here are some tips to help you get started journaling:**\\n\\n* Don’t think you need to write pages of words a day. A simple sentence can be considered a journal entry.\\n* Analog systems are incredibly satisfying to use, but your journal can be digital. There are loads of apps out there to try. If you use Mac or IOS, why not give [Apple Notes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Notes_(Apple)) a go?\\n* Start simple or get creative. It’s your notebook. Do with it as you will.\\n* Watch some Youtube tutorials on journalling. There are loads of ideas out there, and don’t be ashamed to copy someone else’s system. Chances are you will develop your system over time. I use the ‘Perfect Day’ system that I created myself. Let me know if you’d like me to write more about it.\\n* No matter how small, go ahead, and start. You can stop anytime you want if you feel that after a few days or weeks that it’s not for you.\\n\\n## Give Yourself a Break.\\n\\nTo end this article, I want to leave you with one last piece of advice. When times get tough, don’t be too hard on yourself. You will have the best intentions of making the most out of your day but it will fail. Life happens. and seemingly more so when you work from home.\\n\\nWhen this happens, try your best to recover your day as best as you can. Don’t beat yourself up. Dust yourself off and try again tomorrow. It’s going to happen, and it happens to us all who already work from home. Staying productive while working from home is tough – but you’re tougher. Get it done.\\n\\n\\\\----  \\n\\n\\n\\\\[TL:DR\\\\]\\n\\n1. Take time to prepare\\n2. Develop a routine.\\n3. Take a breather.\\n4. Work to your strengths.\\n5. Try Journaling\\n6.

       " '3 Ways to Protect Morale While Working From Home It looks like we’ll be working from home for some time to come – and chances are, you are too!

We didn’t skip a beat in the early weeks of stay-at-home orders, but over time we have noticed a change in company culture. Our Colorado office misses having lunch together outside, and our London office misses regular happy hours. \\n\\nAs we’ve worked to keep relationships strong, spark creativity and boost morale, we’ve\\xa0concluded that these three things are critical:\\xa0 \\n\\n### \\xa01. Stay Social\\xa0\\n\\nNothing replaces the spontaneous chit-chat of a busy office environment. We’re missing out on team lunches, last-minute brainstorm sessions, and walking meetings – but we don’t have to miss out on socialization.

Be Transparent \\n\\nIt may be tempting to de-emphasize difficult news or gloss over poor results during these unprecedented times – don’t.\\xa0[Multiple studies](https://www.forbes.com/sites/williamcraig/2018/10/16/10-things-transparency-can-do-for-your-company/#5bb33ab425d0)\\xa0have confirmed that transparency is a top factor in employee happiness.

Protect Work-Life\\xa0Balance \\n\\nJust because employees are only steps away from their desks, doesn’t mean they should always be available. When we don’t have to commute home or pick up kids or travel, it can be tempting\\xa0to check your email “one last time,” or squeeze in “one last task” before bed.

I will be happy to share the findings of this research with every participant via email.\\n\\nLink:- [**https://forms.gle/RnQfdWme6HU4jYz37**](https://forms.gle/RnQfdWme6HU4jYz37)\\n\\nThanks\",\n",
       " 'Could someone help me with this? I’m currently enrolled in a ui/ux design class and at the moment we are practicing gathering data though user interviews. I was wondering in anyone here has around 15 minutes to spare for me to get some info? The topic is the pain point for millennials working from home. So I would like it if you were a millennial that works from home. If you’re a little out of the millennial age group that is fine']"

It’s been a dream I get to sleep in no commute I’ve watched literally everything on netflix. I’ve done all the things I’ve always wanted to but always held off because work got in the way. For years big corps have been sitting on there asses making crazy money off our work. I think it’s our turn to sit at home and collect cheques. I just don’t get it’s so frustrating I did everything right I played the whole “ oh I’m so productive this is so much better the the office ” card but they didn’t bite. I don’t know what to do I feel like I’m gonna melt down, 2 years at home “working” collecting a cheque every Friday and now it’s over I actually have to go in and be productive. God help me 😪😪😢😭😖😟',\n",
       " \"Extraverted boss wants me back in the office. How do I tell her no? I work for a very small company (less than 20 people). For the last two years, I've been allowed to WFH the majority of the time. It's been amazing for my overall mood and productivity and I love the flexibility it brings to my day. I'm very introverted and find the office environment to be draining and distracting. I've had to go into the office for about 2-3 months last year (some of that was hybrid). I was told that I needed to be there in case they needed help with clients (never happened). My office was upstairs in a corner where I was mostly left alone since no one else up there was back in the office yet. My boss informed me this week that I'll be coming back into the office next week for at least the next month and then maybe they'll think about letting me work from home a day or two a week (unlikely). Unlike last time, my office got moved downstairs so I can help out with clients, since we are going to be short a receptionist. Plus almost everyone will be back in the office, so the noise levels and interruptions will increase. We are starting up in-person client meetings and the head boss doesn't want us to use the bathroom during those times. There could be meetings anywhere from 2 to 6 hours a day! I'm so miserable at the idea of going back. I plan on job searching, but I would really appreciate any ideas on how to tell my boss that coming back into the office is untenable. When she talked to me there was no room for my feedback, as though her mind was made up even though she knows I adamantly want to WFH. Any suggestions?\",\n",

       " 'WFH Lunchtime is something else I just started a new job. I get a half hour paid lunch. \\n\\nAt my old job - in fast food - my UNPAID lunch was spent sitting and staring at the wall, because it was my time to zone out. No customers. No drinks. But there was the dread of going back. Of donning a headset. Sometimes I’d forget a lunch and I’d eat some crap, processed breakfast sandwich. \\n\\nLunch now? I took out my dog. I vacuumed. I made a healthy wrap. I snuggled my kitty. I felt re-energized. It wasn’t a break FROM work, it was a brief return to life.',\n",
       " \"Work from Home Manifesto I have worked the last 2 years at home, having just started a new position before going home for COVID. This has been the best 2 years of my life. Being able to spend this much time with my family and seeing my kids grow up. I wouldn’t trade it for the world. Going back to the office was always inevitable. My company has never changed their tune, and I understand their opinion and decision. My company hasn’t changed, but I have. I have changed opinion not only because of my family, but I’ve also changed my opinion on what is the most effective way to do my job. Not only have I enjoyed working from home to be around my family, I have been able to focus more on my work. I have developed more, I have learned more, and I am more effective on a daily basis. More than I can be driving into the office.\\n\\nI know some have a different opinion that there is an invaluable experience in working in an office and collaborating with others. I personally don’t know if I believe this or not. I don’t know if I’d have the skills I have today, having worked in an office for this long. Maybe I wouldn’t have learned and grown as much. Or maybe like the last 2 years, I would have learned and grown faster. I do know that the majority of people saying you need to be in the office, also have power over people in the office and they have the biggest desks, and offices with doors. Maybe they’ve spent so much time and energy acquiring this office stature that they don’t want to lose that?\\n\\nI know some are saying just suck it up and be a man, or woman. Be a man, or woman, and just drive into work. I believe a man, or woman, should suck it up and go to work, and provide for their family. The question is what does your job entail? Are you driving to work in a cubicle farm because you think that’s the profitable thing for the company? If you’re like me and believe you're more profitable for the company when you’re working from home, then you’re just driving to the cubicle farm for your boss. You are being your boss’ bitch. Then you’re going around calling others childish.\\n\\nIn conclusion I’ve poured a lot of time and effort into doing a great job for my company the last 2 years. Now I feel like I’m asked to drive in (take a pay cut). Give up time at home. And perform my job less effectively. Who’s winning? The person in the big office probably sleeps better, I hope the power trip improves their sex too.\",\n",

Hey, I'm fairly new into a job now (a few months) and it's a good job, but the commute is tiring and I'm spending quite a bit of my salary on just petrol.

From landscaping, fencing, roofing, to repairing &amp; restoring tennis &amp; basketball courts. \\n\\nI was introduced to WFH through my ex last year. We had started spending a lot of time together and she was over a lot so it was only convenient for her to start working from home at my place. Some call center insurance thing, I’m not really sure. Point is, even though I’ve always known of WFH jobs existing, especially with them popping up a lot more during the pandemic, I never for a second considered I could ever find a decent position at a place I’d want to work that would pay me what doing labor work was. I mean while it’s nice to sit home all day and not sweat in the summer heat, my ex was only making like 15-16/hr while I was doing 22. I mean the difference is negligible but it was enough for me to keep the ideations of leaving my job in the back of my head… until three weeks ago. \\n\\nWe have these times off around this season as it starts to get to cold to work with paint on tennis courts, so instead we’re put on unemployment and told to come back around spring. Most of the guys I work with simply go back to their home countries during this time (el salvador mostly) or hunker down collecting unemployment while doing minimal under the table work in the meantime. It’s not a bad deal tbh, 400 a week plus whatever you make under the table. \\n\\nTrouble for me was, I lost my car 2 weeks ago. That halted any traveling I could do to make money in the meantime while also collecting unemployment. And so these ideations came circling back around. \\n\\nThe problem as I saw it was, my resume consisted of nothing that would even remotely reflect I would perform well at a call center. I mean I’ve never even been to college. So what do I do? I go to r/resumes and scour the bunch for something I can use that would reflect well to potential WFH employers. I don’t straight up steal someone’s resume, what I did is pick &amp; choose from multiple people’s descriptions of their jobs, people’s accolades/achievements, even goddamn degrees &amp; certificates. \\n\\nThen I went on indeed and probably applied to about 20 places in the span of like 30 minutes. It was about midnight I was doing this. I wake up the next morning to a text at 8:39am asking if I’m me.

Your resume has been reviewed for the position of a Customer Services Representative, we would like to invite you to an interview and we pay nothing less than $30 hourly, Kindly reply if you are still interested for more info.

I was extremely skeptical the entire time thinking I was being scammed, waiting for the ball to drop where I’m asked to send in a photo id with ssn or something along those lines. But no, it was a fairly typical interview, took about an hour, and I was told I impressed the interviewer and his superiors. They promptly sent me an offer letter &amp; w-4 form which I signed &amp; sent back.\\n\\nMind you, this isn’t the first time I’ve lied to get a job.

       " 'Would quitting my job be worth it? I’m a 27 year old, white collar worker in a large, decently affordable city. I work in Public Relations (PR) and by any standard have had great jobs in my “sub-industry” of the PR world. \\n\\nWhen Covid hit in March of 2020, my firm went full remote (like everyone else). Around May of 2021 our firm emailed us notifying us that we’d be returning to the office 3 days a week starting mid-summer. \\n\\nI was extremely anxious about returning to the office - not because I was afraid of Covid (I had  a very mild case, recovered in a day or so and am vaccinated so my experience was a whole lot easier than some others). I was anxious because I had built a pretty damn good lifestyle for myself after getting used to WFH 5 days a week. \\n\\nI was working out 5x or more a week, had crafted a super healthy diet that I was actually sticking to, had energy to go meet up with friends for a beer on weekdays or cook a healthy, complicated meal. All of this led to improved physical and mental health - I lost 20 pounds and have never been more confident in myself and happy in my relationships with my SO, friends and family.\\n\\nFast forward to 2 months into working at the office 3 days a week and WFH 2 days and I find myself slipping on my diet and workout routine and overall am less happy. I have less energy to workout and cook after commuting and am less motivated generally. \\n\\nI do not hate my job - I love the skills I get to use and generally like my boss/coworkers. My only complaint is that it’s an old school firm - in office M-F 9-5, wear a suit, glad hand people - not really my vibe at all. \\n\\nMy fear is that they will start to force us into the office 5 days a week soon. If they do that, should I consider giving them (generous) notice that I would be leaving?\\n\\nIt’s a great firm with an awesome reputation in the city, but there are so many jobs in this industry that would gladly hire someone with my skill level/experience for similar pay/benefits with the added plus of a flexible WFH policy. \\n\\nAny advice/insight would be appreciated.

       " 'I can\\'t go back Hello. 37yo female here, working from home for the past year and a half. At the beginning of the pandemic, our incredible boss found a new job and we inherited a boss from another office (job was supposed to be advertised ... hasn\\'t been yet and his old position was eliminated and I was directed to remove the word \"interim\" from his title on our website so ... ). After 3 months of being home during the pandemic, one of our team members died (cancer). We are a small team of 8 (now 7). We transitioned well to working from home and went full steam ahead until the new guy took over full-time. There\\'s been no direction. And since our old boss was truly an amazing human who could lead us and keep open communication to superiors transparent ... when she left, we no longer seemed to matter because we lost our champion. We\\'re supposed to go back into the office in a few weeks.\\n\\nThe past year and a half we were told to go home and make space in our lives for a work area. We set up our offices, we worked through logistics and used our own internet service; we conformed and respected it. It was not seamless, but we made it work and for many of us, it was an eye-opening experience. No commute, no uncomfortable work clothes, no having to stay in one spot. The ability to spend more time with our families, to load the washing machine on our lunch break, to take our laptop outside on beautiful days, to be ourselves, to enjoy our homes, to work in a comfortable and safe environment. I have actually been able to cook breakfast, lunch and dinner almost daily for my family and it has been incredible.\\n\\nWhen I was hired, I remember specifically during orientation it was stressed to us how much they cared about the work-life balance and how remote working and flexibility were options in almost every position. Unfortunately, beyond the ability to adjust start/end times by an hour, I never felt those options up until pandemic times … but now I see that nothing has really changed, at least in our area. I have valued life more in the past year and a half than I have in a long time. But being forced back into an office for 8 hours a day makes me feel like my life is not valued by the place I give a lot of it to daily. I have cried, I have stressed so much my sleep and the quality of day-to-day living has suffered, I have spent about $300 to try to find clothes that are “professional” enough (even though I only see my co-workers and don’t have clients or anything like that daily ... I\\'m still required to dress like I do) yet provide some level of comfort like what I’ve been used to wearing, I have reached out for help in my network and found that there are many others in the same boat who have found or are in the process of finding remote options that SO many businesses have embraced. I have looked into EAP options, as well, because I know my mental health is suffering right now. It seems silly, but I am grieving my life from the last year and a half. I have been more productive, safer and ultimately happier at home. All of my responsibilities can be completed remotely, aside from when we have in-person experiences that require my assistance (and I am more than happy to help out as needed, but will always mask up and keep my distance as much as possible in those situations).\\n\\nI had pneumonia in 2019 and legit almost died. I have lung damage and have been encouraged by HR to pursue ADA options, but it feels like then I\\'ll be the \"problem\" and will be eliminated. I could be wrong. I hope I\\'d be wrong. Just scared. I feel like I\\'d be singled out.\\n\\nI went into my office this afternoon after hours. I had cards on my board from my old boss. A gift from my coworker who had passed. Reminders of old projects. A coloring page I had hung on my wall in 2020 where each month is block letters divided into spaces for each day of the month. I\\'d colored to March 15 and no more. It felt like visiting a tomb. Or some unsafe, dead zone. I cannot go back to that 8 hours a day and I don\\'t know what I\\'m going to do. We\\'ve been given zero options for flexibility.',\n",

Throughout this period we have been the busiest we have ever have been in the history of the company and acheived record sales turnover (at least double our previous annual turnover) - all whilst we have been working from home full time.\\n\\nMy Directors have contacted me saying they want me to put a plan together to bring all the sales team back to the office on a full time basis i.e. no longer working from home.  I expressed that I would like them to consider flexibibly of working from home and office e.g. 3 days working from home and 2 days in the office.  They are reluctant because \"I\\'m the manager and its expected of me to be in the office full time\".\\n\\nMy main reasons for flexible working are:\\n\\n\\\\- Inflation and there are no signifacant pay rises are about to be introduced from the company\\n\\n\\\\- I have saved considerable amounts of money on transportation (fuel) costs.\\n\\n\\\\- The atmosphere is horrible and negative in the office\\n\\n\\\\- I\\'ve become more productive when working from home with less interruptions (we have an open office at the company)\\n\\n\\\\- I can conduct private managerial matters which I can\\'t conduct in an open office\\n\\n\\\\- I\\'ve become far more mentally positive working from home\\n\\n&amp;#x200B;\\n\\nDespite the remote systems I have put in place since March 2020 in order for us to be very effecient and productive, the only reason they want us back in the office is because they are the micro-mangement style of directors.

Using that amount and the average commute distance, the cost of the average commute is:\\n\\n      16 miles each way\\n    x 2 times a day\\n    x 5 days per week\\n    x 50 working weeks per year \\n    x $0.56 per mile\\n    --------------------------------\\n    $4,480 per year\\n\\nSo for the average American, eliminating a commute is the equivalent of getting **a $4,500 raise and two weeks off.** This is an intentionally conservative estimate, and doesn't take into account things like:\\n\\n - Parking costs\\n - Public transit costs\\n - Worker time costs\\n - Cost of office space\\n\\nNot to mention all of the hard-to-quantify things like mental health, location flexibility, and improved productivity. \\n\\nSo when you're looking for a WFH job it might make sense to accept lower pay if your boss is making go back to your very long commute.\",\n",

If I\\'d had to guess I\\'d say I\\'m working from home about 75% of the time and visiting with clients the other 25%; I have no obligation or reason to visit the office unless I want to print a bunch of stuff and don\\'t want to waste my ink at home. Our meetings and trainings are virtual 99% of the time (we\\'ve met twice at a park before).\\n\\nWe have access to several offices but only one is delegated as our \"home office\". This is a problem for me and I\\'ll explain why below. \\n\\nFor our expense report we are required to deduct a one way commute if we visit our home office while in the field, or a round trip commute if we never visit the office and do field work. \\n\\nMy problem is, the home office is 16.4 miles away from my home one way. If I\\'m in the field and never visit the office that\\'s 32.8 miles shaved off my travel time with clients, etc. so often times I\\'m only getting reimbursed $2-$3 for traveling 38 miles for example. \\n\\nAnother office is about 6 miles away and I\\'d feel better deducting that commute because I actually do visit that office much more, although it\\'s not my \"home\" office.\\n\\nI honestly feel like we shouldn\\'t have to deduct a commute at all since we aren\\'t required to visit the office anyway.

       " \"WFH rant/productivity challenges - can anyone relate I've never been a morning person, literally my entire life. I don't think that will change. I'm 30 years old now and still naturally wake up at 10 am and go to sleep at 2 am. (I have tried to change) But I have ADD and this year has ruined any routine I have ever had.  \\n\\nI hated wfh full time when lock down first started. My company was also ill equipped to wfh, a little behind the times. During lock down we worked from home for about 5 months returning in July to the office. When we went back initially it was Monday-Thursday. But now we go to the office 3 days a week, and those days are optional for some of the staff if there are no meetings, this does not apply to me though. My manager said we will be back 5 days a week again soon. Unfortunately it took me getting Covid at the office for my manager to even let us wfh part time. I'm really not happy about returning to a 5 day work week because wfh at least 1 day a week has been so beneficial to my work life balance. I like a mix of both, being at the office and at home. I think office workers deserve 1 day a week to wfh if they want. Not having to commute just one day allows me to get so much done in my personal life that I would otherwise have to do on a Saturday. Not to mention I am more well rested and productive at the office. There is nothing worse than being at work and you are overly exhausted or don't have a project. Those empty hours could be spent at home.\\n\\nAnyway, I've noticed when I wfh I am more productive with my detailed/research projects. I am able to hyper focus at home. I can get more things done in a shorter amount of time vs. the office. This unfortunately allows me to procrastinate more than I should. My problem I have been struggling with lately is that when I am at home I tend to work better at night. Or I like to log on over the weekend and work. So during the work day I turn my computer on at 9:30 and am logged on until 5:30 for any urgent issues.

The only snag I can think of, and there's probably something obvious I'm overlooking, is what happens when I need to be in a meeting where everyone but me is in the office. Our conference rooms have video and all, but our offices don't and smaller meetings (like maybe 5 people) often take place in offices. Do I Zoom in on one person's laptop? Rely on speakerphone (please no)? I would obviously schedule as many meetings as possible for office days but if I have to go to the office every time there's a meeting in a room without video conferencing capabilities, I'll end up WFH maybe 1 day a week.\\n\\nWhat do y'all do?\",\n",

       " 'Some tips on how to stay productive and healthy while working from home! Hey everyone,  \\n\\n\\nI was working in the live entertainment industry for nearly a decade, which got totally whooped when covid hit. Since then, I\\'ve gone from a life on the road to starting a localized seo business - and staying productive has been one hell of a learning process. When I started I was putting in 40-50 rather unproductive hours a week, but now I can usually finish everything I need in 25-35 hours.   \\n\\n\\nFigured I\\'d share a few tips I\\'ve learned from starting a business and working a semi-normal work from home schedule. Staying motivated is always a challenge, but I believe I\\'ve come a long way. The trick is you just gotta keep trying - and understand that no one is 100% productive all the time.\\n\\n&amp;#x200B;\\n\\n1. **Have a separate work-only station**\\n   1. I\\'m a musician at heart, so when I started my business I was doing it from my studio workstation (which also has games installed). Would find myself getting distracted by a guitar, or music software, or world of warcraft... stuff like that. I ended up clearing out a spare room in my house, dressed it up aesthetically, and put in a small desk with a laptop that was totally dedicated to work. It has helped immensely. Sets the stage for a productive, \"it\\'s time to work now\" mindset.\\n   2. Make your working area look nice, too. I try to keep mine as clean as possible and since I don\\'t have a window in the room, I\\'ve added a UV light and a bunch of plants. I put a tower for my cat to hang out with me, a small fish tank, and have covered the walls in art. \\n2. **Try your absolute best to stick to your schedule**\\n   1. Time spent alone is more productive if it\\'s structured. Sounds pretty obvious - and it is always a fight to maintain - but wake up and go to bed at the same time. Try your best to stop working at 5pm, or whatever works for you.\\n   2. Include breaks, too. I usually give myself 10 minutes for every hour of work.\\n   3. If you struggle to get up, brew a pot of coffee before bed and put it in a thermos. Place it right next to your bed and when you wake up, take big gulp. If you do it at the same time for a few days in a row, you\\'ll stop needing to drink the coffee. \\n3. **Move your body**\\n   1. I love my standing desk and use it constantly. Will generally stand for a third of the day. I also notice that standing makes me a bit more alert and engaged for calls and meetings with clients\\n   2. I put a yoga mat in the room and will usually try to do small, quick reps of squats and pushups throughout the day. Nothing crazy, but just enough to get the blood flowing\\n   3. I also try to take a 10-15 minute walk everyday, usually after lunch time with my kids!\\n4. **Communicate with your buds**\\n   1. In localized seo, we use blog networks with other SEOs to help rank our sites. I have made some really good buddies doing this and we have some facebook and discord groups to keep in touch. Sure, it can be a bit distracting at times, but it\\'s really nice to have people to chat with during the day. I\\'m sure you can do the same with your co-workers. Guess what I\\'m trying to say is that it\\'s okay to be social, even if it means being a little less productive, because humans are meant to be social.\\n   2. That being said, never shy away from a video call. I think people feel more comfortable emailing and chatting, but I always find my best calls are the ones where I can see the faces of my clients and partners. \\n5. **Have lunch with your family/house mates**\\n   1. While my wife is an essential worker, my kids are still at home. I always make a point to enjoy lunch with them. You can do the same with whoever you live with.\\n6. **Being comfortable** **is worth it**\\n   1. Don\\'t skimp on your chair, or the things you use constantly every day.\\n   2. The same goes for your desk. Get something that makes you look forward to using.\\n   3. Hell, if you can afford, buy a nice mechanical keyboard. They\\'re so much better than normal keyboards. \\n7. **Use lists**\\n   1. I always start my day with writing down the most important things I need to get done with a few sub tasks under that.\\n      1. If I finish everything on my list, then I\\'m done for the day.\\n8. **Still dress up for work**\\n   1. I still wake up and take a shower, shave, ect... and also try to put on somewhat normal clothes. Just gets me in the mindset to work and helps me maintain my routine.\\n9. **Play music**\\n   1. **...**if it\\'s not distracting to you. I usually listen to super ambient stuff, like Tycho or Helios. Spotify has a ton of great ambient soundtracks. If my kids are being loud, sometimes I\\'ll just throw on some brown/white noise or rain sounds. \\n   2. Also, sound cancelling headphones are awesome if you don\\'t have a separate work station.\\n10. **Be grateful you get to work from home**\\n   1. Before I started my business and even tour managing, I worked in a office. I hated it and knew it wasn\\'t the life I wanted to live. When I\\'m feeling super unmotivated I try to think back to how I felt at my first out of college job - and I try to be thankful that I currently have the freedom to work in an environment that I much prefer. \\n\\nLosing my tour managing career to COVID was awful - and feeling like I needed to conform to the 9-5 grind didn\\'t help at all. I took a massive leap of faith in starting my seo business. But hey, things are finally working out and if things keep going well, I can probably go back to tour management when things go back to normal. That being said, I hope your own work situation is going well - and I hope that my tips have been useful! Have a great day and thank you for reading :)',\n",

       " \"Extraverted boss wants me back in the office. How do I tell her no? I work for a very small company (less than 20 people). For the last two years, I've been allowed to WFH the majority of the time. It's been amazing for my overall mood and productivity and I love the flexibility it brings to my day. I'm very introverted and find the office environment to be draining and distracting. I've had to go into the office for about 2-3 months last year (some of that was hybrid). I was told that I needed to be there in case they needed help with clients (never happened). My office was upstairs in a corner where I was mostly left alone since no one else up there was back in the office yet. My boss informed me this week that I'll be coming back into the office next week for at least the next month and then maybe they'll think about letting me work from home a day or two a week (unlikely). Unlike last time, my office got moved downstairs so I can help out with clients, since we are going to be short a receptionist. Plus almost everyone will be back in the office, so the noise levels and interruptions will increase. We are starting up in-person client meetings and the head boss doesn't want us to use the bathroom during those times. There could be meetings anywhere from 2 to 6 hours a day! I'm so miserable at the idea of going back. I plan on job searching, but I would really appreciate any ideas on how to tell my boss that coming back into the office is untenable. When she talked to me there was no room for my feedback, as though her mind was made up even though she knows I adamantly want to WFH. Any suggestions?\",\n",

       " \"Work from Home Manifesto I have worked the last 2 years at home, having just started a new position before going home for COVID. This has been the best 2 years of my life. Being able to spend this much time with my family and seeing my kids grow up. I wouldn’t trade it for the world. Going back to the office was always inevitable. My company has never changed their tune, and I understand their opinion and decision. My company hasn’t changed, but I have. I have changed opinion not only because of my family, but I’ve also changed my opinion on what is the most effective way to do my job. Not only have I enjoyed working from home to be around my family, I have been able to focus more on my work. I have developed more, I have learned more, and I am more effective on a daily basis. More than I can be driving into the office.\\n\\nI know some have a different opinion that there is an invaluable experience in working in an office and collaborating with others. I personally don’t know if I believe this or not. I don’t know if I’d have the skills I have today, having worked in an office for this long. Maybe I wouldn’t have learned and grown as much. Or maybe like the last 2 years, I would have learned and grown faster. I do know that the majority of people saying you need to be in the office, also have power over people in the office and they have the biggest desks, and offices with doors. Maybe they’ve spent so much time and energy acquiring this office stature that they don’t want to lose that?\\n\\nI know some are saying just suck it up and be a man, or woman. Be a man, or woman, and just drive into work. I believe a man, or woman, should suck it up and go to work, and provide for their family. The question is what does your job entail? Are you driving to work in a cubicle farm because you think that’s the profitable thing for the company? If you’re like me and believe you're more profitable for the company when you’re working from home, then you’re just driving to the cubicle farm for your boss. You are being your boss’ bitch. Then you’re going around calling others childish.\\n\\nIn conclusion I’ve poured a lot of time and effort into doing a great job for my company the last 2 years. Now I feel like I’m asked to drive in (take a pay cut). Give up time at home. And perform my job less effectively. Who’s winning? The person in the big office probably sleeps better, I hope the power trip improves their sex too.\",\n",

Others and even my manager frequently work remote when the weather is bad, or even if they have some personal stuff to deal with such as doc appointment, someone is coming to the house to fix something, (insert random excuse here), etc..\\n\\nMy question is this.. I commute 45 minutes each way. I’ve been asking for a laptop now for 6 months. I do not get the work remote privilege that my coworkers get and am expected to report to the office everyday (design work, really could wfh permanently) or otherwise take PTO/unpaid time. Is this fair? I have had some close calls driving on snow and ice to the office while most of my coworkers can comfortably and safely stay home and work. Again I (and a couple others) have been nagging and requesting management for laptops. Is there anything else we can do? Any legal issue here? This doesn’t seem right to me. \\n\\nThanks all for reading and the advice!',\n",

       " 'Just got hired at a company paying me $32/hr after completely &amp; utterly lying on every aspect of my resume I’m 26 and have worked absolutely nothing but labor jobs for probably the past 7 years. From landscaping, fencing, roofing, to repairing &amp; restoring tennis &amp; basketball courts. \\n\\nI was introduced to WFH through my ex last year. We had started spending a lot of time together and she was over a lot so it was only convenient for her to start working from home at my place. Some call center insurance thing, I’m not really sure. Point is, even though I’ve always known of WFH jobs existing, especially with them popping up a lot more during the pandemic, I never for a second considered I could ever find a decent position at a place I’d want to work that would pay me what doing labor work was. I mean while it’s nice to sit home all day and not sweat in the summer heat, my ex was only making like 15-16/hr while I was doing 22. I mean the difference is negligible but it was enough for me to keep the ideations of leaving my job in the back of my head… until three weeks ago. \\n\\nWe have these times off around this season as it starts to get to cold to work with paint on tennis courts, so instead we’re put on unemployment and told to come back around spring. Most of the guys I work with simply go back to their home countries during this time (el salvador mostly) or hunker down collecting unemployment while doing minimal under the table work in the meantime. It’s not a bad deal tbh, 400 a week plus whatever you make under the table. \\n\\nTrouble for me was, I lost my car 2 weeks ago. That halted any traveling I could do to make money in the meantime while also collecting unemployment. And so these ideations came circling back around. \\n\\nThe problem as I saw it was, my resume consisted of nothing that would even remotely reflect I would perform well at a call center. I mean I’ve never even been to college. So what do I do? I go to r/resumes and scour the bunch for something I can use that would reflect well to potential WFH employers. I don’t straight up steal someone’s resume, what I did is pick &amp; choose from multiple people’s descriptions of their jobs, people’s accolades/achievements, even goddamn degrees &amp; certificates. \\n\\nThen I went on indeed and probably applied to about 20 places in the span of like 30 minutes. It was about midnight I was doing this. I wake up the next morning to a text at 8:39am asking if I’m me. I say yes and this is the copy &amp; pasted reply I get, names changed. \\n\\n“I’m Mr. Bean from Big Bean. Your resume has been reviewed for the position of a Customer Services Representative, we would like to invite you to an interview and we pay nothing less than $30 hourly, Kindly reply if you are still interested for more info. Thank you!” \\n\\nLong story short (I know I just told the entire story, please forgive me I am black this is what we do) we go through the interview process and I absolutely crush it because I’m really good with words (it was a text interview through Wire). I was extremely skeptical the entire time thinking I was being scammed, waiting for the ball to drop where I’m asked to send in a photo id with ssn or something along those lines. But no, it was a fairly typical interview, took about an hour, and I was told I impressed the interviewer and his superiors. They promptly sent me an offer letter &amp; w-4 form which I signed &amp; sent back.\\n\\nMind you, this isn’t the first time I’ve lied to get a job. Hell, it’s not even close to the most egregious lie to get a job I’ve done. But it’s insane to me that I could still lie for this level of income. \\n\\nTL;DR: title',\n",

But I guess I just feel 'unproductive' because I keep getting distracted EVERY day - I'll do work for an hour, and then be bored and want to be on my phone. Or I'll remember things and look them up in the middle of another task because I don't want to forget. \\n\\nI almost feel like a failure because I worry that soon my boss will realize that I'm not working a full 8 hour day, I am barely scraping by, and it kills me. My therapist recommended that I ask my boss for support, but I'm just so scared that I'm going to out myself on the work that I haven't done.

At the beginning of the pandemic, our incredible boss found a new job and we inherited a boss from another office (job was supposed to be advertised ... hasn\\'t been yet and his old position was eliminated and I was directed to remove the word \"interim\" from his title on our website so ... ). After 3 months of being home during the pandemic, one of our team members died (cancer). We are a small team of 8 (now 7). We transitioned well to working from home and went full steam ahead until the new guy took over full-time. There\\'s been no direction. And since our old boss was truly an amazing human who could lead us and keep open communication to superiors transparent ... when she left, we no longer seemed to matter because we lost our champion. We\\'re supposed to go back into the office in a few weeks.\\n\\nThe past year and a half we were told to go home and make space in our lives for a work area. We set up our offices, we worked through logistics and used our own internet service; we conformed and respected it. It was not seamless, but we made it work and for many of us, it was an eye-opening experience. No commute, no uncomfortable work clothes, no having to stay in one spot. The ability to spend more time with our families, to load the washing machine on our lunch break, to take our laptop outside on beautiful days, to be ourselves, to enjoy our homes, to work in a comfortable and safe environment. I have actually been able to cook breakfast, lunch and dinner almost daily for my family and it has been incredible.\\n\\nWhen I was hired, I remember specifically during orientation it was stressed to us how much they cared about the work-life balance and how remote working and flexibility were options in almost every position. Unfortunately, beyond the ability to adjust start/end times by an hour, I never felt those options up until pandemic times … but now I see that nothing has really changed, at least in our area. I have valued life more in the past year and a half than I have in a long time. But being forced back into an office for 8 hours a day makes me feel like my life is not valued by the place I give a lot of it to daily. I have cried, I have stressed so much my sleep and the quality of day-to-day living has suffered, I have spent about $300 to try to find clothes that are “professional” enough (even though I only see my co-workers and don’t have clients or anything like that daily ... I\\'m still required to dress like I do) yet provide some level of comfort like what I’ve been used to wearing, I have reached out for help in my network and found that there are many others in the same boat who have found or are in the process of finding remote options that SO many businesses have embraced. I have looked into EAP options, as well, because I know my mental health is suffering right now. It seems silly, but I am grieving my life from the last year and a half. I have been more productive, safer and ultimately happier at home.

I am efficient at my work, so after 2 PM I’m already done with the day, and need to wait until 4 to leave. What do I do?\\n\\nI am a marketing specialist, and i have 2 freelance clients. Sometimes during the time I’m at the office I also work on freelance stuff but my clients don’t pay me as much so spendingALL my remaining time on them isnt doable. \\n\\nHow have people handled having to go back to the office…? Thank God my commute is only 15 minutes. But- HOW? \\n\\nI’d rather spend my half days cuddling with my pup and practicing spiritualism at home. Not stuck in an office with NO windows. \\n\\nPS: I’m debating wether to send an email to my supervisor to learn about what efforts are being made by my union to send us back to remote work…..any tips on that also appreciated!',\n",

       " '[UK] Working from home flexiblity help Hi\\n\\nI\\'m a sales office manager at a company.  Since March 2020 we have been working from home due to the pandemic.  Throughout this period we have been the busiest we have ever have been in the history of the company and acheived record sales turnover (at least double our previous annual turnover) - all whilst we have been working from home full time.\\n\\nMy Directors have contacted me saying they want me to put a plan together to bring all the sales team back to the office on a full time basis i.e. no longer working from home.  I expressed that I would like them to consider flexibibly of working from home and office e.g. 3 days working from home and 2 days in the office.  They are reluctant because \"I\\'m the manager and its expected of me to be in the office full time\".\\n\\nMy main reasons for flexible working are:\\n\\n\\\\- Inflation and there are no signifacant pay rises are about to be introduced from the company\\n\\n\\\\- I have saved considerable amounts of money on transportation (fuel) costs.\\n\\n\\\\- The atmosphere is horrible and negative in the office\\n\\n\\\\- I\\'ve become more productive when working from home with less interruptions (we have an open office at the company)\\n\\n\\\\- I can conduct private managerial matters which I can\\'t conduct in an open office\\n\\n\\\\- I\\'ve become far more mentally positive working from home\\n\\n&amp;#x200B;\\n\\nDespite the remote systems I have put in place since March 2020 in order for us to be very effecient and productive, the only reason they want us back in the office is because they are the micro-mangement style of directors.

       " \"Doing the math on commutes A lot of companies are pushing employees to come back to the office, so I thought it would be good to provide some hard numbers on what a commute actually costs in terms of both time and money.\\n\\nAccording to the [US Census Bureau](https://www.census.gov/newsroom/press-releases/2021/one-way-travel-time-to-work-rises.html), the average American commute is 27.6 minutes long. So the total time per year they spend commuting is:\\n\\n      27.6 minutes\\n    x 2 times a day\\n    x 5 days per week\\n    x 50 working weeks per year\\n    ---------------------------\\n    13,800 minutes per year\\n\\n13,800 minutes is 230 hours, or almost **ten days per year.**\\n\\nIn terms of the cost of car commuting, [in 2005 ABC news said](https://abcnews.go.com/Technology/Traffic/story?id=485098&amp;page=1) the average commute distance is 16 miles.\\n\\nThe IRS lets you deduct [56¢ per mile](https://www.irs.gov/newsroom/irs-issues-standard-mileage-rates-for-2021) for *non-commuting* business travel you aren't reimbursed for. Using that amount and the average commute distance, the cost of the average commute is:\\n\\n      16 miles each way\\n    x 2 times a day\\n    x 5 days per week\\n    x 50 working weeks per year \\n    x $0.56 per mile\\n    --------------------------------\\n    $4,480 per year\\n\\nSo for the average American, eliminating a commute is the equivalent of getting **a $4,500 raise and two weeks off.** This is an intentionally conservative estimate, and doesn't take into account things like:\\n\\n - Parking costs\\n - Public transit costs\\n - Worker time costs\\n - Cost of office space\\n\\nNot to mention all of the hard-to-quantify things like mental health, location flexibility, and improved productivity. \\n\\nSo when you're looking for a WFH job it might make sense to accept lower pay if your boss is making go back to your very long commute.\",\n",

       " 'WFH but deducting travel commute question TLDR; what are your thoughts or experiences on working a mostly remote job but having to deduct a home-to-office travel commute due to company policy if you travel locally for work purposes at times?\\n\\nI live in Sacramento, CA and started working a new job in January of this year and it\\'s remote/field work, as there is no specific office space allocated for my coworkers or myself in our specific department (the 2 managers share an office) at any of the company locations. If I\\'d had to guess I\\'d say I\\'m working from home about 75% of the time and visiting with clients the other 25%; I have no obligation or reason to visit the office unless I want to print a bunch of stuff and don\\'t want to waste my ink at home. Our meetings and trainings are virtual 99% of the time (we\\'ve met twice at a park before).\\n\\nWe have access to several offices but only one is delegated as our \"home office\". This is a problem for me and I\\'ll explain why below. \\n\\nFor our expense report we are required to deduct a one way commute if we visit our home office while in the field, or a round trip commute if we never visit the office and do field work. \\n\\nMy problem is, the home office is 16.4 miles away from my home one way. If I\\'m in the field and never visit the office that\\'s 32.8 miles shaved off my travel time with clients, etc. so often times I\\'m only getting reimbursed $2-$3 for traveling 38 miles for example. \\n\\nAnother office is about 6 miles away and I\\'d feel better deducting that commute because I actually do visit that office much more, although it\\'s not my \"home\" office.\\n\\nI honestly feel like we shouldn\\'t have to deduct a commute at all since we aren\\'t required to visit the office anyway. I asked employees that have been at the company pre-covid if things have changed and they say that it\\'s pretty much the same, there were more in person meetings but they expected our department to be in the field 90% of the time except for meetings, etc.\\n\\n I feel like we\\'re being slighted and I\\'m going to complete my expense report the way *I* feel like it should be and see if my boss will address it with me so I can tell her all of this. \\n\\nWhat are your thoughts on this, is this right or legal?

       " \"WFH rant/productivity challenges - can anyone relate I've never been a morning person, literally my entire life. I don't think that will change. I'm 30 years old now and still naturally wake up at 10 am and go to sleep at 2 am. (I have tried to change) But I have ADD and this year has ruined any routine I have ever had.  \\n\\nI hated wfh full time when lock down first started. My company was also ill equipped to wfh, a little behind the times. During lock down we worked from home for about 5 months returning in July to the office. When we went back initially it was Monday-Thursday. But now we go to the office 3 days a week, and those days are optional for some of the staff if there are no meetings, this does not apply to me though. My manager said we will be back 5 days a week again soon. Unfortunately it took me getting Covid at the office for my manager to even let us wfh part time. I'm really not happy about returning to a 5 day work week because wfh at least 1 day a week has been so beneficial to my work life balance. I like a mix of both, being at the office and at home. I think office workers deserve 1 day a week to wfh if they want. Not having to commute just one day allows me to get so much done in my personal life that I would otherwise have to do on a Saturday. Not to mention I am more well rested and productive at the office. There is nothing worse than being at work and you are overly exhausted or don't have a project. Those empty hours could be spent at home.\\n\\nAnyway, I've noticed when I wfh I am more productive with my detailed/research projects. I am able to hyper focus at home. I can get more things done in a shorter amount of time vs. the office. This unfortunately allows me to procrastinate more than I should. My problem I have been struggling with lately is that when I am at home I tend to work better at night. Or I like to log on over the weekend and work. So during the work day I turn my computer on at 9:30 and am logged on until 5:30 for any urgent issues. I always meet all of my deadlines, but have been finding it difficult to spend that 9:30-5:30 time at home actually working. I feel pretty guilty about it and it makes me a little depressed.

       " 'Some tips on how to stay productive and healthy while working from home! Hey everyone,  \\n\\n\\nI was working in the live entertainment industry for nearly a decade, which got totally whooped when covid hit. Since then, I\\'ve gone from a life on the road to starting a localized seo business - and staying productive has been one hell of a learning process. When I started I was putting in 40-50 rather unproductive hours a week, but now I can usually finish everything I need in 25-35 hours.   \\n\\n\\nFigured I\\'d share a few tips I\\'ve learned from starting a business and working a semi-normal work from home schedule. Staying motivated is always a challenge, but I believe I\\'ve come a long way. The trick is you just gotta keep trying - and understand that no one is 100% productive all the time.\\n\\n&amp;#x200B;\\n\\n1. **Have a separate work-only station**\\n   1. I\\'m a musician at heart, so when I started my business I was doing it from my studio workstation (which also has games installed). Would find myself getting distracted by a guitar, or music software, or world of warcraft... stuff like that. I ended up clearing out a spare room in my house, dressed it up aesthetically, and put in a small desk with a laptop that was totally dedicated to work. It has helped immensely. Sets the stage for a productive, \"it\\'s time to work now\" mindset.\\n   2. Make your working area look nice, too. I try to keep mine as clean as possible and since I don\\'t have a window in the room, I\\'ve added a UV light and a bunch of plants. I put a tower for my cat to hang out with me, a small fish tank, and have covered the walls in art. \\n2. **Try your absolute best to stick to your schedule**\\n   1. Time spent alone is more productive if it\\'s structured. Sounds pretty obvious - and it is always a fight to maintain - but wake up and go to bed at the same time. Try your best to stop working at 5pm, or whatever works for you.\\n   2. Include breaks, too. I usually give myself 10 minutes for every hour of work.\\n   3. If you struggle to get up, brew a pot of coffee before bed and put it in a thermos. Place it right next to your bed and when you wake up, take big gulp. If you do it at the same time for a few days in a row, you\\'ll stop needing to drink the coffee. \\n3. **Move your body**\\n   1. I love my standing desk and use it constantly. Will generally stand for a third of the day. I also notice that standing makes me a bit more alert and engaged for calls and meetings with clients\\n   2. I put a yoga mat in the room and will usually try to do small, quick reps of squats and pushups throughout the day. Nothing crazy, but just enough to get the blood flowing\\n   3. I also try to take a 10-15 minute walk everyday, usually after lunch time with my kids!\\n4. **Communicate with your buds**\\n   1. In localized seo, we use blog networks with other SEOs to help rank our sites. I have made some really good buddies doing this and we have some facebook and discord groups to keep in touch. Sure, it can be a bit distracting at times, but it\\'s really nice to have people to chat with during the day. I\\'m sure you can do the same with your co-workers. Guess what I\\'m trying to say is that it\\'s okay to be social, even if it means being a little less productive, because humans are meant to be social.\\n   2. That being said, never shy away from a video call. I think people feel more comfortable emailing and chatting, but I always find my best calls are the ones where I can see the faces of my clients and partners. \\n5. **Have lunch with your family/house mates**\\n   1. While my wife is an essential worker, my kids are still at home. I always make a point to enjoy lunch with them. You can do the same with whoever you live with.\\n6. **Being comfortable** **is worth it**\\n   1. Don\\'t skimp on your chair, or the things you use constantly every day.\\n   2. The same goes for your desk. Get something that makes you look forward to using.\\n   3. Hell, if you can afford, buy a nice mechanical keyboard. They\\'re so much better than normal keyboards. \\n7. **Use lists**\\n   1. I always start my day with writing down the most important things I need to get done with a few sub tasks under that.\\n      1. If I finish everything on my list, then I\\'m done for the day.\\n8. **Still dress up for work**\\n   1. I still wake up and take a shower, shave, ect... and also try to put on somewhat normal clothes. Just gets me in the mindset to work and helps me maintain my routine.\\n9. **Play music**\\n   1. **...**if it\\'s not distracting to you. I usually listen to super ambient stuff, like Tycho or Helios. Spotify has a ton of great ambient soundtracks. If my kids are being loud, sometimes I\\'ll just throw on some brown/white noise or rain sounds. \\n   2. Also, sound cancelling headphones are awesome if you don\\'t have a separate work station.\\n10. **Be grateful you get to work from home**\\n   1. Before I started my business and even tour managing, I worked in a office. I hated it and knew it wasn\\'t the life I wanted to live. When I\\'m feeling super unmotivated I try to think back to how I felt at my first out of college job - and I try to be thankful that I currently have the freedom to work in an environment that I much prefer. \\n\\nLosing my tour managing career to COVID was awful - and feeling like I needed to conform to the 9-5 grind didn\\'t help at all. I took a massive leap of faith in starting my seo business. But hey, things are finally working out and if things keep going well, I can probably go back to tour management when things go back to normal. That being said, I hope your own work situation is going well - and I hope that my tips have been useful! Have a great day and thank you for reading :)',\n",

       " 'The Advantages of Having a Backyard Office Working from home has become the new normal, especially since COVID-19. The situation might not change as quickly as we want it to be and all we can do is try to adapt and learn how to balance work and personal life under one roof.\\n\\nFinding the right space that will allow you to concentrate on your work, conduct [effective business meetings ](https://blog.mombit.io/business-meeting-agenda-template/)and fulfill all of your professional duties has become a priority for many employees all over the world. Setting up your office at the kitchen table, in the kid’s room or in the cramped basement can’t simply cut it. If you’re going to work remotely, you will need that peace and quiet, especially if the whole family is staying at home 24/7 due to COVID-19 restrictions.\\n\\nThat’s how the backyard office became one of the most popular solutions to our trendy work from home problems. When the whole family works from home and the kids are distance-learning, heading to the backyard allows you to have that much-needed personal space. Separating the spaces we use is crucial to keeping the work/life balance and investing in a backyard shed might be the right way to achieve it.\\n\\n**So, What Exactly is a Backyard Office?**\\n\\nA backyard office is basically a shed, located in your backyard which you use as a designated office space. It’s an outdoor space that is adapted into an area suited to work from home. Backyard sheds are serving the needs of people who are working from home and are in desperate search for a way to avoid clashing with other family members who are also working or studying from home.\\n\\nLocating your office in the backyard is not a newly-emerging concept. However, in 2020 it was the COVID-19 situation that transformed the backyard office into an established trend.\\n\\nFurthermore, shed companies are now giving people tons of options and opportunities to design, furnish and customize their sheds however they want to. Now, the backyard office is not just a way to distance your professional life from your home/personal life but it’s also a great way to work in a place that’s been entirely created based on your own personal taste, needs and comfort.\\n\\n**Increase in Sales of Sheds**\\n\\nShed companies, especially from the U.S.A., have reported a significant increase in sales. Business is booming as shed manufacturers have focused on fulfilling every need, ranging from compact home office structures to deluxe or more elaborate custom designs. LA-based manufacturers, for instance, have reported that sales for prefab backyard offices have increased by 250&amp; since mid-April\\n\\nHumble sheds are no longer wanted. Companies are designing complex structures and focusing on functionalities by adding features like operable windows, solar panels for power and more.\\n\\nOf course, the classic cottages are still here to stay. However, these days people who work from home invest in more modern-looking sheds that mimic small house designs.\\n\\nIn terms of investment, a typical prefab backyard office can cost you between $10k-$30k. Of course, the price depends on features such as plumbing, smart office equipment, windows, solar panels and more. Moreover, what you should also keep in mind is the need and cost for a building permit, which also varies depending on your location and the size of the shed.\\n\\nMany work-from-home people think that this is just a small price to pay for ensuring convenience, peace and quiet while focusing on work and performing their daily job responsibilities.\\n\\n**What are the advantages of the backyard office?**\\n\\nI’ve briefly touched upon several of those advantages, the main one being that an outdoor office shed provides a personal space and a clear separation between life and work, while you’re still technically in your own home. **What are some other benefits of having a backyard home office?**\\n\\n* **It’s not that expensive to do it.** If you want to remodel your house and add another room, it will cost you a lot of time and money. Buying a shed, however, is affordable and just as good of a solution to your problems with personal work space.\\n* **All the** [**work-from-home benefits**](https://velinablogging.medium.com/working-from-home-stresses-you-out-5b67f3b17482) **are still kept**. Some of those include flexible schedules, no travelling and being closer to your loved ones.\\n* **There are plenty of backyard office solutions out there to choose from.** You can design your outdoor office the way you’ve always imagined! Wooden exterior, sliding doors, energy-efficient windows, solar power packages controlled with your smartphone or Alexa are just a very few of the options you have for your backyard shed. Not just that but now you can bring back the inner decorator in you and furnish it the way you want to.\\n* **It doesn’t take that long to build it.** Depending on the type of shed you purchase, it may take from 2 days to 2 weeks but no more. This is nothing compared to the time it will take you to add another room to your house.  \\nFrom ordering a prefabricated structure to having your first Zoom team meeting will take you less than a week.\\n* **You can enjoy fresh air and natural light.** This is something we rarely think about when we used to work in the office. Now, you can customize your backyard office studio with sliding doors or plenty of windows you can open at any time. There’s nothing better than working outside and getting a good dose of vitamin D.\\n* **Everyone can benefit from having their own backyard office, regardless of their occupation.** Whether you’re a businessman, a marketing manager or a writer or artist, you can only benefit from investing in a personal outdoor office or studio.\\n* **Your new backyard office shed can be made from sustainable elements** and you can utilize solar panels or renewable energy generators to keep the project as green as possible.\\n* **Multipurpose!** Think about that. An office shed can be where you work throughout the day but it can be so much more than that when you’re finished with your work. You will equip the shed with a computer, probably a TV and you can even add a bed. It can become the perfect place where you and your children can play video games. Not just that but if you include a bed or a gold out couch in it, it can also turn into a guest room when required.\\n* **No noise pollution.** You will immediately spot the difference. If your office used to be located in a busy city area with vehicles driving past each other and people talking or shouting all over the place, you were probably feeling quite stressed about it. Now, you can escape into your shed and enjoy peace and quiet while you’re coming up with the next big business idea!\\n* **An office shed located in your backyard can increase your home’s value.** This is something that you’re not thinking about right now but one day, your outside office can increase the value of your house as much as 5–7% if it’s in a good state. Your investment now will surely bring you profit one day when you decide to move somewhere else and sell your house.\\n\\n**Final thoughts**\\n\\nWorking from home is here to stay. Even without the COVID-19 pandemic, there are a huge number of people who have been practicing remote work for years now. That’s why designating a specific area where you can focus on work has become increasingly important.\\n\\nA backyard office or studio is definitely a great solution to your problems. If things get too cramped inside the house, it’s definitely a wise decision to invest in a shed. Cheap backyard office sheds are offered by many companies these days. You can also design it the way you’ve always imagined your office would look like. You want a soundproofed room or an office space where you can blast your music while working on your next project? You can have it all!\\n\\nBuilding comfort for yourself and your career will ultimately help you grow as a professional. That new level of relaxation and solitude is directly tied to improved efficiency and productivity. Now, all you have to do is check shed manufacturers near you and start preparing for your new office!\\n\\n&amp;#x200B;\\n\\nSource: [RIP, Office!

       " 'How to Stay Productive While Working From Home I wrote this as an article and thought to post this here too. What tips do you use to stay productive while working from home? \\n\\n\\\\----\\n\\n# How to Stay Productive While Working From Home\\n\\nWorking from home can be a dream. It can also be very challenging. Since the world seems to be adopting a work from home mindset, I wanted to share some tips on how to stay productive while working from home that I have found helpful over the years.\\n\\n## Take Time to Prepare\\n\\nWhen working from home, you must prepare for the day ahead. You don’t want to be caught like a deer in headlights when your alarm clock rings. Think about it. You are working from ‘home.’ Your home is a place of rest, relaxation, and distractions. Generally speaking, a home is not a place designed for maximum deep work and productivity – it’s a jungle.\\n\\nNow that we have established that our homes are a minefield of personal and professional obstacles, it is easy to see why having a plan going into your day is so important.\\n\\n### Start planning a day in advance\\n\\nTake some time at the end of your workday. Look through the tasks of the day and check off everything that you have accomplished. Now it’s time to make a new list. Write down a list of everything that you would like to do tomorrow. Make sure to include any tasks that you didn’t get around to during the day.\\n\\nWith your list more or less completed, take a moment and think about what your day is going to looks like tomorrow. If you’d like, you can stack this process with another good habit of cleaning your desk (more on this in the next step). While thinking about the next day, you may find you need to consult with a team lead or partner. Check-in with them to see if there is anything that they might require you to do. Maybe you need to run an errand for a spouse, meet with a potential client, or start dinner a little earlier. You should have a compiled list of tasks at this point, and already a clearer picture of what the next day would look like.\\n\\n### Grab the Calender\\n\\nTake your list and sit down with your calendar. At this point, you want to try to visualize your day as best as possible. This process is not supposed to be perfect, but rather a rough outline of your day. Try to be realistic with the time it takes to complete tasks. Give yourself some leeway, and don’t expect a robot-like performance from yourself. Again, be realistic.\\n\\n&amp;#x200B;\\n\\n## Develop a Routine\\n\\nSimilar to planning your day, a routine is there to help define boundaries for your home and office. Do you remember a time when you worked a job at an office? Chances are you had to be out of bed at a specific time; you performed a particular set of tasks to get ready and have some commute before arriving to work. While those things may have seemed like a drag at the time, they were helping you to get available for work.\\n\\nOnce we get into the flow of a routine, often, it may seem like we are in auto-pilot mode. Slowly drifting along until arriving at our destination. A routine helps prime your brain and body for the next event. Once a set of tasks are completed, like waking up, brushing your teeth, and driving to work, your brain is ready to do the next event – usually, work.\\n\\nBecause we work from home, you might find it a bit difficult to have a set routine. Each day is different because we are privileged (and cursed) enough to have flexibility. If you just roll out of bed and open your laptop on Monday, but only start working in the afternoon on Tuesday, you might have a difficult time trying to focus or getting in the zone when it’s time to work.\\n\\n### Start-Up Routine\\n\\nTry to set up a simple start-up routine to get into the swing of things. You have the freedom to set this routine and start at any time that best suits you. A start-up routine doesn’t have to be time-consuming, complex, and cumbersome.\\n\\nI am currently trying a simple routine. When I am ready to start work (which is usually more or less the same time every morning), I head out the front door for a quick 10-minute walk around my neighborhood. When I get back home, I put on some coffee and wait for it to brew while casually browsing my phone. After the coffee is ready, I pour a cup for myself and my wife and head to the office. As you can see, this is almost mimicking a commute along with grabbing a coffee before sitting down to work. I find that a 10-minute break to be alone and outside helps re-align my thoughts. It also adds some distance from myself and my home. It allows me to refresh my brain, ready to take on the workday ahead.\\n\\n### Shutdown Routine\\n\\nSimilar to the start-up routine, the shutdown routine happens at the end of your day. When you’re ready to “Pack up” and go home, I’ll admit, some days, I rush out my home office and into the kitchen. But ideally, I like to first close all my browser tabs and apps on my computer. Start making a list of to-do’s for the next day, and clean my desk. If I am feeling like a groggy-zombie, I like heading outside to get some fresh air or take a quick walk around the block to clear my head.\\n\\nWhen I get back home, my brain has been reset and I am ready to spend time with my family.\\n\\n## Take a Breather\\n\\nHave you ever had a friend jealously ask you about your workday? Maybe they begrudgingly scuff at the thought of you doing an hour of work while the rest of your day is spent lounging around?\\n\\nThis could not be farther from the truth, at least in my experience. As a remote worker, I find it incredibly easy to sit in front of my computer for a copious amount of hours at a time – not a good idea.\\n\\nTry taking regular breaks. While this may sound easy, it is pretty tricky to put into practice. Frequent breaks are essential to staying productive while working at home. Your body needs it, and you might find that you perform better by taking these small but frequent breathers—bonus points for having your break outside.\\n\\n## Work to Your Strengths.\\n\\nThe beauty of working from home is that you have the power of flexibility at your disposal. Mostly, as long as you can get your work done promptly, companies don’t mind when and how you get your job done.\\n\\nIf you’re an early bird, go ahead and get started nice and early. Prefer to take on your tasks like a cape crusader in the night? Why not? You might need to clarify this with your team leader, but if they say it’s all good, you’re ready to roll – whatever time suits you best.\\n\\nI prefer to work later in the day or even at night. My family dynamics, however, have me working closer to a standard 9 to 5 office hours kind of deal.\\n\\nWork to your strengths. You have the power to leverage your natural productive abilities when you feel most productive.\\n\\n## Try Journaling\\n\\nI would love to be more consistent in this regard, but I find journalling a great tool to stay productive while working from home. Journaling no matter how simple is fantastic at developing one’s self-awareness muscles. This self-awareness comes in handy when you need to realign a routine. Speak up in a meeting or know when to take a break (or push a little bit harder).\\n\\n### Bullet Journal\\n\\nI use a simple Bullet Journal method that helps me record my day’s tasks, organize my thoughts, and take note of new ideas. My bullet journal is also my anchor. If I am working, it is right by my side, ready to be flipped through and scribbled in at a moment’s notice.\\n\\nThere are a lot of different journaling methods that can boost productivity, creativity, and personal development. I use the Bullet Journal system, but I’d encourage you to find a journaling method that best suits you.\\n\\n**Here are some tips to help you get started journaling:**\\n\\n* Don’t think you need to write pages of words a day. A simple sentence can be considered a journal entry.\\n* Analog systems are incredibly satisfying to use, but your journal can be digital. There are loads of apps out there to try. If you use Mac or IOS, why not give [Apple Notes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Notes_(Apple)) a go?\\n* Start simple or get creative. It’s your notebook. Do with it as you will.\\n* Watch some Youtube tutorials on journalling. There are loads of ideas out there, and don’t be ashamed to copy someone else’s system. Chances are you will develop your system over time. I use the ‘Perfect Day’ system that I created myself. Let me know if you’d like me to write more about it.\\n* No matter how small, go ahead, and start. You can stop anytime you want if you feel that after a few days or weeks that it’s not for you.\\n\\n## Give Yourself a Break.\\n\\nTo end this article, I want to leave you with one last piece of advice. When times get tough, don’t be too hard on yourself. You will have the best intentions of making the most out of your day but it will fail. Life happens. and seemingly more so when you work from home.\\n\\nWhen this happens, try your best to recover your day as best as you can. Don’t beat yourself up. Dust yourself off and try again tomorrow. It’s going to happen, and it happens to us all who already work from home. Staying productive while working from home is tough – but you’re tougher. Get it done.\\n\\n\\\\----  \\n\\n\\n\\\\[TL:DR\\\\]\\n\\n1. Take time to prepare\\n2. Develop a routine.\\n3. Take a breather.\\n4. Work to your strengths.\\n5. Try Journaling\\n6. Take it easy on yourself.',\n",

       " '3 Ways to Protect Morale While Working From Home It looks like we’ll be working from home for some time to come – and chances are, you are too! At Lineup, we’ve found many silver linings to working remotely. It’s easier to juggle time zone differences and easier to\\xa0dial in from around the world. We didn’t skip a beat in the early weeks of stay-at-home orders, but over time we have noticed a change in company culture. Our Colorado office misses having lunch together outside, and our London office misses regular happy hours. \\n\\nAs we’ve worked to keep relationships strong, spark creativity and boost morale, we’ve\\xa0concluded that these three things are critical:\\xa0 \\n\\n### \\xa01. Stay Social\\xa0\\n\\nNothing replaces the spontaneous chit-chat of a busy office environment. We’re missing out on team lunches, last-minute brainstorm sessions, and walking meetings – but we don’t have to miss out on socialization. Research shows that having strong relationships among coworkers is massively beneficial, personally and\\xa0[professionally](https://www.forbes.com/sites/jacquelynsmith/2013/09/24/how-much-coworker-socializing-is-good-for-your-career/#14bbcfc151a0).\\xa0 \\n\\nIt takes a little more effort to keep employees across different teams and departments socially connected when you’re not going into the office – but this effort can do wonders for overall employee morale. Here are some ideas: \\n\\n* Host regular “[Virtual Coffee Breaks](http://www.lineup.com/newsroom/25-fun-ideas-for-your-next-virtual-coffee-break/)” with specific topics of conversation and video required.\\xa0 \\n* Enjoy a friendly competition at the end of a workday – we did\\xa0[team-wide trivia with prizes!](https://www.linkedin.com/feed/update/urn:li:activity:6668938027567525888) \\n* Try a tool like\\xa0[Donut](https://www.donut.com/),\\xa0which connect teammates who might not otherwise chat.\\xa0\\n\\n### 2. Be Transparent \\n\\nIt may be tempting to de-emphasize difficult news or gloss over poor results during these unprecedented times – don’t.\\xa0[Multiple studies](https://www.forbes.com/sites/williamcraig/2018/10/16/10-things-transparency-can-do-for-your-company/#5bb33ab425d0)\\xa0have confirmed that transparency is a top factor in employee happiness. You may believe that by keeping bad news quiet, you’re avoiding a drop in morale, but the opposite is true.\\xa0 \\n\\nMake transparency an integral part of your culture now, and you’ll reap rewards long after everyone is back at the office. Whether it’s being open about your\\xa0[pandemic recovery strategy](https://hbr.org/2020/03/are-you-leading-through-the-crisis-or-managing-the-response), your plan for getting back to the office, or even\\xa0[personal transparency](https://hbr.org/2019/02/how-leaders-can-open-up-to-their-teams-without-oversharing), make sure you’re fostering a culture of trust with every communication to your employees.\\xa0 \\n\\n### 3. Protect Work-Life\\xa0Balance \\n\\nJust because employees are only steps away from their desks, doesn’t mean they should always be available. When we don’t have to commute home or pick up kids or travel, it can be tempting\\xa0to check your email “one last time,” or squeeze in “one last task” before bed. Of course, no one can stop your employees from doing this\\xa0completely ([surveys show](https://www.timedoctor.com/blog/remote-teams-future-of-work/)\\xa0that remote employees work longer hours on average). Even still, emphasizing the value of work-life balance, combating\\xa0[Zoom fatigue](https://www.mindful.org/zoom-exhaustion-is-real-here-are-six-ways-to-find-balance-and-stay-connected/), and being kind to parents who are now homeschooling can do wonders for morale.\\xa0 \\n\\nAt Lineup, we’ve blocked out lunch hours for each region and asked that internal meetings not\\xa0be\\xa0scheduled over that time.

There are many positives - the commute, the company, the dress code, and the flexibility. Work has actually helped keep me motivated and productive in a time when I needed it.

      "Extraverted boss wants me back in the office. How do I tell her no? I work for a very small company (less than 20 people). For the last two years, I've been allowed to WFH the majority of the time. It's been amazing for my overall mood and productivity and I love the flexibility it brings to my day. I'm very introverted and find the office environment to be draining and distracting. I've had to go into the office for about 2-3 months last year (some of that was hybrid). I was told that I needed to be there in case they needed help with clients (never happened). My office was upstairs in a corner where I was mostly left alone since no one else up there was back in the office yet. My boss informed me this week that I'll be coming back into the office next week for at least the next month and then maybe they'll think about letting me work from home a day or two a week (unlikely). Unlike last time, my office got moved downstairs so I can help out with clients, since we are going to be short a receptionist. Plus almost everyone will be back in the office, so the noise levels and interruptions will increase. We are starting up in-person client meetings and the head boss doesn't want us to use the bathroom during those times. There could be meetings anywhere from 2 to 6 hours a day! I'm so miserable at the idea of going back. I plan on job searching, but I would really appreciate any ideas on how to tell my boss that coming back into the office is untenable. When she talked to me there was no room for my feedback, as though her mind was made up even though she knows I adamantly want to WFH. Any suggestions?\n",

      "Work from Home Manifesto I have worked the last 2 years at home, having just started a new position before going home for COVID. This has been the best 2 years of my life. Being able to spend this much time with my family and seeing my kids grow up. I wouldn’t trade it for the world. Going back to the office was always inevitable. My company has never changed their tune, and I understand their opinion and decision. My company hasn’t changed, but I have. I have changed opinion not only because of my family, but I’ve also changed my opinion on what is the most effective way to do my job. Not only have I enjoyed working from home to be around my family, I have been able to focus more on my work. I have developed more, I have learned more, and I am more effective on a daily basis. More than I can be driving into the office.\n",

Or maybe like the last 2 years, I would have learned and grown faster. I do know that the majority of people saying you need to be in the office, also have power over people in the office and they have the biggest desks, and offices with doors. Maybe they’ve spent so much time and energy acquiring this office stature that they don’t want to lose that?\n",

It's a bit of a commute to work and some days the work I do I could do all from home. So, I'd be keen to work from home like 1 day a week just to break up the week and reduce fuel costs a little. I just  don't know how to ask or phrase it to my boss without coming across like I just want a day off or like I'm not committed to the job. None of the others there have a set day working from home each week though do WFH now and then. Is there a good way to ask or phrase it without sounding lazy or taking advantage of the current climate?\n",

      "How do ya'll counteract the physical toll of sitting all week? Working from home (and just on a computer all day in general, I suppose) is really taking a toll on my body lately. I try to get out and go for a walk/run every morning before starting work, and do my best to take breaks to get up and stretch/move throughout the day, but I'm still finding that it's becoming increasingly hard to sit so much without major discomfort. It's mostly in my hips and sometimes lower back, and it's getting to the point that I've had to take a few short work days lately because I felt like I couldn't physically sit any longer. I live in a tiny house, so a standing desk/big ergonomic computer chair is unfortunately not an option. I recently bought the cushion lab seat cushion hoping it would help, but I'm still struggling. At the beginning of the week it's usually manageable, but after a week of sitting I'm really uncomfortable. Any advice?? Tips to help with posture? Stretches? It's wild, I've worked strenuous outdoor labor jobs, yet this one takes the cake as far as wear and tear on my body goes. I'm only 31, but starting to worry that sitting all day is going to cause long-term damage if I don't figure something out soon!\n",

I mean while it’s nice to sit home all day and not sweat in the summer heat, my ex was only making like 15-16/hr while I was doing 22.

After 3 months of being home during the pandemic, one of our team members died (cancer). We are a small team of 8 (now 7). We transitioned well to working from home and went full steam ahead until the new guy took over full-time. There's been no direction.

The ability to spend more time with our families, to load the washing machine on our lunch break, to take our laptop outside on beautiful days, to be ourselves, to enjoy our homes, to work in a comfortable and safe environment.

I have valued life more in the past year and a half than I have in a long time. But being forced back into an office for 8 hours a day makes me feel like my life is not valued by the place I give a lot of it to daily.

I'm still required to dress like I do) yet provide some level of comfort like what I’ve been used to wearing, I have reached out for help in my network and found that there are many others in the same boat who have found or are in the process of finding remote options that SO many businesses have embraced. I have looked into EAP options, as well, because I know my mental health is suffering right now. It seems silly, but I am grieving my life from the last year and a half.

      "I hated wfh full time when lock down first started. My company was also ill equipped to wfh, a little behind the times. During lock down we worked from home for about 5 months returning in July to the office. When we went back initially it was Monday-Thursday. But now we go to the office 3 days a week, and those days are optional for some of the staff if there are no meetings, this does not apply to me though. My manager said we will be back 5 days a week again soon. Unfortunately it took me getting Covid at the office for my manager to even let us wfh part time. I'm really not happy about returning to a 5 day work week because wfh at least 1 day a week has been so beneficial to my work life balance. I like a mix of both, being at the office and at home. I think office workers deserve 1 day a week to wfh if they want. Not having to commute just one day allows me to get so much done in my personal life that I would otherwise have to do on a Saturday.

      "Figured I'd share a few tips I've learned from starting a business and working a semi-normal work from home schedule. Staying motivated is always a challenge, but I believe I've come a long way. The trick is you just gotta keep trying - and understand that no one is 100% productive all the time.\n",
      "\n",
      "&amp;#x200B;\n",
      "\n",
      "1. **Have a separate work-only station**\n",
      "   1. I'm a musician at heart, so when I started my business I was doing it from my studio workstation (which also has games installed). Would find myself getting distracted by a guitar, or music software, or world of warcraft... stuff like that. I ended up clearing out a spare room in my house, dressed it up aesthetically, and put in a small desk with a laptop that was totally dedicated to work. It has helped immensely. Sets the stage for a productive, \"it's time to work now\" mindset.\n",
      "   2. Make your working area look nice, too. I try to keep mine as clean as possible and since I don't have a window in the room, I've added a UV light and a bunch of plants. I put a tower for my cat to hang out with me, a small fish tank, and have covered the walls in art. \n",
      "2. **Try your absolute best to stick to your schedule**\n",
      "   1. Time spent alone is more productive if it's structured. Sounds pretty obvious - and it is always a fight to maintain - but wake up and go to bed at the same time. Try your best to stop working at 5pm, or whatever works for you.\n",
      "   2. Include breaks, too. I usually give myself 10 minutes for every hour of work.\n",
      "   3. If you struggle to get up, brew a pot of coffee before bed and put it in a thermos. Place it right next to your bed and when you wake up, take big gulp. If you do it at the same time for a few days in a row, you'll stop needing to drink the coffee. \n",
      "3. **Move your body**\n",
      "   1. I love my standing desk and use it constantly. Will generally stand for a third of the day. I also notice that standing makes me a bit more alert and engaged for calls and meetings with clients\n",
      "   2. I put a yoga mat in the room and will usually try to do small, quick reps of squats and pushups throughout the day. Nothing crazy, but just enough to get the blood flowing\n",
      "   3. I also try to take a 10-15 minute walk everyday, usually after lunch time with my kids!\n",
      "4. **Communicate with your buds**\n",
      "   1. In localized seo, we use blog networks with other SEOs to help rank our sites. I have made some really good buddies doing this and we have some facebook and discord groups to keep in touch. Sure, it can be a bit distracting at times, but it's really nice to have people to chat with during the day. I'm sure you can do the same with your co-workers. Guess what I'm trying to say is that it's okay to be social, even if it means being a little less productive, because humans are meant to be social.\n",
      "   2. That being said, never shy away from a video call. I think people feel more comfortable emailing and chatting, but I always find my best calls are the ones where I can see the faces of my clients and partners. \n",
      "5. **Have lunch with your family/house mates**\n",
      "   1. While my wife is an essential worker, my kids are still at home. I always make a point to enjoy lunch with them. You can do the same with whoever you live with.\n",
      "6. **Being comfortable** **is worth it**\n",
      "   1. Don't skimp on your chair, or the things you use constantly every day.\n",
      "   2. The same goes for your desk. Get something that makes you look forward to using.\n",
      "   3. Hell, if you can afford, buy a nice mechanical keyboard. They're so much better than normal keyboards. \n",
      "7. **Use lists**\n",
      "   1. I always start my day with writing down the most important things I need to get done with a few sub tasks under that.\n",
      "      1. If I finish everything on my list, then I'm done for the day.\n",
      "8. **Still dress up for work**\n",
      "   1. I still wake up and take a shower, shave, ect... and also try to put on somewhat normal clothes. Just gets me in the mindset to work and helps me maintain my routine.\n",
      "9. **Play music**\n",
      "   1. **...**if it's not distracting to you. I usually listen to super ambient stuff, like Tycho or Helios. Spotify has a ton of great ambient soundtracks. If my kids are being loud, sometimes I'll just throw on some brown/white noise or rain sounds. \n",
      "   2. Also, sound cancelling headphones are awesome if you don't have a separate work station.\n",
      "10. **Be grateful you get to work from home**\n",
      "   1. Before I started my business and even tour managing, I worked in a office. I hated it and knew it wasn't the life I wanted to live. When I'm feeling super unmotivated I try to think back to how I felt at my first out of college job - and I try to be thankful that I currently have the freedom to work in an environment that I much prefer. \n",
      "\n",
      "Losing my tour managing career to COVID was awful - and feeling like I needed to conform to the 9-5 grind didn't help at all. I took a massive leap of faith in starting my seo business. But hey, things are finally working out and if things keep going well, I can probably go back to tour management when things go back to normal. That being said, I hope your own work situation is going well - and I hope that my tips have been useful! Have a great day and thank you for reading :)\n",

      "Extraverted boss wants me back in the office. How do I tell her no? I work for a very small company (less than 20 people). For the last two years, I've been allowed to WFH the majority of the time. It's been amazing for my overall mood and productivity and I love the flexibility it brings to my day. I'm very introverted and find the office environment to be draining and distracting. I've had to go into the office for about 2-3 months last year (some of that was hybrid). I was told that I needed to be there in case they needed help with clients (never happened). My office was upstairs in a corner where I was mostly left alone since no one else up there was back in the office yet. My boss informed me this week that I'll be coming back into the office next week for at least the next month and then maybe they'll think about letting me work from home a day or two a week (unlikely). Unlike last time, my office got moved downstairs so I can help out with clients, since we are going to be short a receptionist. Plus almost everyone will be back in the office, so the noise levels and interruptions will increase. We are starting up in-person client meetings and the head boss doesn't want us to use the bathroom during those times. There could be meetings anywhere from 2 to 6 hours a day! I'm so miserable at the idea of going back. I plan on job searching, but I would really appreciate any ideas on how to tell my boss that coming back into the office is untenable. When she talked to me there was no room for my feedback, as though her mind was made up even though she knows I adamantly want to WFH. Any suggestions?\n"

Being able to spend this much time with my family and seeing my kids grow up. I wouldn’t trade it for the world. Going back to the office was always inevitable. My company has never changed their tune, and I understand their opinion and decision. My company hasn’t changed, but I have. I have changed opinion not only because of my family, but I’ve also changed my opinion on what is the most effective way to do my job. Not only have I enjoyed working from home to be around my family, I have been able to focus more on my work. I have developed more, I have learned more, and I am more effective on a daily basis. More than I can be driving into the office.\n",

Or maybe like the last 2 years, I would have learned and grown faster. I do know that the majority of people saying you need to be in the office, also have power over people in the office and they have the biggest desks, and offices with doors. Maybe they’ve spent so much time and energy acquiring this office stature that they don’t want to lose that?\n",

Are you driving to work in a cubicle farm because you think that’s the profitable thing for the company? If you’re like me and believe you're more profitable for the company when you’re working from home, then you’re just driving to the cubicle farm for your boss. You are being your boss’ bitch.

      "Best way to suggest WFH to a boss? Hey, I'm fairly new into a job now (a few months) and it's a good job, but the commute is tiring and I'm spending quite a bit of my salary on just petrol. At work, there are days where I sit at a computer the entire day, and other days I go between computer work and tasks that need to be done in person. My boss works around 3/5 days from home, and my other co-workers don't have set days WFH - though one takes WFH days when they feel like it. My work is slightly different to theirs, where I focus a lot more on computer work some days, which is way I would like to WFH a little. \n",

      "So, I was wondering how do I suggest this? I've done a few WFH days due to weather and training, and I've much prefered it (though don't have any tangible proof I get more done even though I feel like I do). I have a meeting with my boss fortnightly, so I was consdiering bring up then, but just not sure how to ask for a permanent 1 or 2 days WFH each week? So any advice would be great! Also, I'm not sure how many days WFH I could get away with, I know they would likely say ok after some thinking to 1 day a week, but I know I'm unlikely to get this opportunity to tweak my working hours again. So, is it best to play it safe and ask for 1 WFH day a week, or try ask for 1 or 2 and see if they would take me up on 2 WFH days?\n",

      "I can't go back Hello. 37yo female here, working from home for the past year and a half. At the beginning of the pandemic, our incredible boss found a new job and we inherited a boss from another office (job was supposed to be advertised ... hasn't been yet and his old position was eliminated and I was directed to remove the word \"interim\" from his title on our website so ... ). After 3 months of being home during the pandemic, one of our team members died (cancer). We are a small team of 8 (now 7). We transitioned well to working from home and went full steam ahead until the new guy took over full-time. There's been no direction. And since our old boss was truly an amazing human who could lead us and keep open communication to superiors transparent ... when she left, we no longer seemed to matter because we lost our champion. We're supposed to go back into the office in a few weeks.\n",

      "The past year and a half we were told to go home and make space in our lives for a work area. We set up our offices, we worked through logistics and used our own internet service; we conformed and respected it. It was not seamless, but we made it work and for many of us, it was an eye-opening experience. No commute, no uncomfortable work clothes, no having to stay in one spot. The ability to spend more time with our families, to load the washing machine on our lunch break, to take our laptop outside on beautiful days, to be ourselves, to enjoy our homes, to work in a comfortable and safe environment. I have actually been able to cook breakfast, lunch and dinner almost daily for my family and it has been incredible.\n",
      "\n",
      "When I was hired, I remember specifically during orientation it was stressed to us how much they cared about the work-life balance and how remote working and flexibility were options in almost every position. Unfortunately, beyond the ability to adjust start/end times by an hour, I never felt those options up until pandemic times … but now I see that nothing has really changed, at least in our area. I have valued life more in the past year and a half than I have in a long time. But being forced back into an office for 8 hours a day makes me feel like my life is not valued by the place I give a lot of it to daily. I have cried, I have stressed so much my sleep and the quality of day-to-day living has suffered, I have spent about $300 to try to find clothes that are “professional” enough (even though I only see my co-workers and don’t have clients or anything like that daily ... I'm still required to dress like I do) yet provide some level of comfort like what I’ve been used to wearing, I have reached out for help in my network and found that there are many others in the same boat who have found or are in the process of finding remote options that SO many businesses have embraced. I have looked into EAP options, as well, because I know my mental health is suffering right now. It seems silly, but I am grieving my life from the last year and a half. I have been more productive, safer and ultimately happier at home. All of my responsibilities can be completed remotely, aside from when we have in-person experiences that require my assistance (and I am more than happy to help out as needed, but will always mask up and keep my distance as much as possible in those situations).\n",

      "I hated wfh full time when lock down first started. My company was also ill equipped to wfh, a little behind the times. During lock down we worked from home for about 5 months returning in July to the office. When we went back initially it was Monday-Thursday. But now we go to the office 3 days a week, and those days are optional for some of the staff if there are no meetings, this does not apply to me though. My manager said we will be back 5 days a week again soon. Unfortunately it took me getting Covid at the office for my manager to even let us wfh part time. I'm really not happy about returning to a 5 day work week because wfh at least 1 day a week has been so beneficial to my work life balance. I like a mix of both, being at the office and at home. I think office workers deserve 1 day a week to wfh if they want. Not having to commute just one day allows me to get so much done in my personal life that I would otherwise have to do on a Saturday. Not to mention I am more well rested and productive at the office. There is nothing worse than being at work and you are overly exhausted or don't have a project. Those empty hours could be spent at home.\n",

My problem I have been struggling with lately is that when I am at home I tend to work better at night. Or I like to log on over the weekend and work. So during the work day I turn my computer on at 9:30 and am logged on until 5:30 for any urgent issues. I always meet all of my deadlines, but have been finding it difficult to spend that 9:30-5:30 time at home actually working. I feel pretty guilty about it and it makes me a little depressed.

Would find myself getting distracted by a guitar, or music software, or world of warcraft... stuff like that. I ended up clearing out a spare room in my house, dressed it up aesthetically, and put in a small desk with a laptop that was totally dedicated to work. It has helped immensely. Sets the stage for a productive, \"it's time to work now\" mindset.\n",
      "   2. Make your working area look nice, too. I try to keep mine as clean as possible and since I don't have a window in the room, I've added a UV light and a bunch of plants. I put a tower for my cat to hang out with me, a small fish tank, and have covered the walls in art. \n",

      "   2. Include breaks, too. I usually give myself 10 minutes for every hour of work.\n",

Sure, it can be a bit distracting at times, but it's really nice to have people to chat with during the day. I'm sure you can do the same with your co-workers. Guess what I'm trying to say is that it's okay to be social, even if it means being a little less productive, because humans are meant to be social.\n",

      "Finding the right space that will allow you to concentrate on your work, conduct [effective business meetings ](https://blog.mombit.io/business-meeting-agenda-template/)and fulfill all of your professional duties has become a priority for many employees all over the world. Setting up your office at the kitchen table, in the kid’s room or in the cramped basement can’t simply cut it. If you’re going to work remotely, you will need that peace and quiet, especially if the whole family is staying at home 24/7 due to COVID-19 restrictions.\n",
      "\n",
      "That’s how the backyard office became one of the most popular solutions to our trendy work from home problems. When the whole family works from home and the kids are distance-learning, heading to the backyard allows you to have that much-needed personal space. Separating the spaces we use is crucial to keeping the work/life balance and investing in a backyard shed might be the right way to achieve it.\n",
      "\n",
      "**So, What Exactly is a Backyard Office?**\n",
      "\n",
      "A backyard office is basically a shed, located in your backyard which you use as a designated office space. It’s an outdoor space that is adapted into an area suited to work from home. Backyard sheds are serving the needs of people who are working from home and are in desperate search for a way to avoid clashing with other family members who are also working or studying from home.\n",
      "\n",
      "Locating your office in the backyard is not a newly-emerging concept. However, in 2020 it was the COVID-19 situation that transformed the backyard office into an established trend.\n",
      "\n",
      "Furthermore, shed companies are now giving people tons of options and opportunities to design, furnish and customize their sheds however they want to. Now, the backyard office is not just a way to distance your professional life from your home/personal life but it’s also a great way to work in a place that’s been entirely created based on your own personal taste, needs and comfort.\n",
      "\n",
      "**Increase in Sales of Sheds**\n",
      "\n",
      "Shed companies, especially from the U.S.A., have reported a significant increase in sales. Business is booming as shed manufacturers have focused on fulfilling every need, ranging from compact home office structures to deluxe or more elaborate custom designs. LA-based manufacturers, for instance, have reported that sales for prefab backyard offices have increased by 250&amp; since mid-April\n",
      "\n",
      "Humble sheds are no longer wanted. Companies are designing complex structures and focusing on functionalities by adding features like operable windows, solar panels for power and more.\n",
      "\n",
      "Of course, the classic cottages are still here to stay. However, these days people who work from home invest in more modern-looking sheds that mimic small house designs.\n",
      "\n",
      "In terms of investment, a typical prefab backyard office can cost you between $10k-$30k. Of course, the price depends on features such as plumbing, smart office equipment, windows, solar panels and more. Moreover, what you should also keep in mind is the need and cost for a building permit, which also varies depending on your location and the size of the shed.\n",
      "\n",
      "Many work-from-home people think that this is just a small price to pay for ensuring convenience, peace and quiet while focusing on work and performing their daily job responsibilities.\n",
      "\n",
      "**What are the advantages of the backyard office?**\n",
      "\n",
      "I’ve briefly touched upon several of those advantages, the main one being that an outdoor office shed provides a personal space and a clear separation between life and work, while you’re still technically in your own home. **What are some other benefits of having a backyard home office?**\n",
      "\n",
      "* **It’s not that expensive to do it.** If you want to remodel your house and add another room, it will cost you a lot of time and money. Buying a shed, however, is affordable and just as good of a solution to your problems with personal work space.\n",
      "* **All the** [**work-from-home benefits**](https://velinablogging.medium.com/working-from-home-stresses-you-out-5b67f3b17482) **are still kept**. Some of those include flexible schedules, no travelling and being closer to your loved ones.\n",
      "* **There are plenty of backyard office solutions out there to choose from.** You can design your outdoor office the way you’ve always imagined! Wooden exterior, sliding doors, energy-efficient windows, solar power packages controlled with your smartphone or Alexa are just a very few of the options you have for your backyard shed. Not just that but now you can bring back the inner decorator in you and furnish it the way you want to.\n",
      "* **It doesn’t take that long to build it.** Depending on the type of shed you purchase, it may take from 2 days to 2 weeks but no more. This is nothing compared to the time it will take you to add another room to your house.  \n",
      "From ordering a prefabricated structure to having your first Zoom team meeting will take you less than a week.\n",
      "* **You can enjoy fresh air and natural light.** This is something we rarely think about when we used to work in the office. Now, you can customize your backyard office studio with sliding doors or plenty of windows you can open at any time. There’s nothing better than working outside and getting a good dose of vitamin D.\n",
      "* **Everyone can benefit from having their own backyard office, regardless of their occupation.** Whether you’re a businessman, a marketing manager or a writer or artist, you can only benefit from investing in a personal outdoor office or studio.\n",
      "* **Your new backyard office shed can be made from sustainable elements** and you can utilize solar panels or renewable energy generators to keep the project as green as possible.\n",
      "* **Multipurpose!** Think about that. An office shed can be where you work throughout the day but it can be so much more than that when you’re finished with your work. You will equip the shed with a computer, probably a TV and you can even add a bed. It can become the perfect place where you and your children can play video games. Not just that but if you include a bed or a gold out couch in it, it can also turn into a guest room when required.\n",
      "* **No noise pollution.** You will immediately spot the difference. If your office used to be located in a busy city area with vehicles driving past each other and people talking or shouting all over the place, you were probably feeling quite stressed about it. Now, you can escape into your shed and enjoy peace and quiet while you’re coming up with the next big business idea!\n",
      "* **An office shed located in your backyard can increase your home’s value.** This is something that you’re not thinking about right now but one day, your outside office can increase the value of your house as much as 5–7% if it’s in a good state. Your investment now will surely bring you profit one day when you decide to move somewhere else and sell your house.\n",
      "\n",
      "**Final thoughts**\n",
      "\n",
      "Working from home is here to stay. Even without the COVID-19 pandemic, there are a huge number of people who have been practicing remote work for years now. That’s why designating a specific area where you can focus on work has become increasingly important.\n",
      "\n",
      "A backyard office or studio is definitely a great solution to your problems. If things get too cramped inside the house, it’s definitely a wise decision to invest in a shed. Cheap backyard office sheds are offered by many companies these days. You can also design it the way you’ve always imagined your office would look like. You want a soundproofed room or an office space where you can blast your music while working on your next project? You can have it all!\n",

      "How to Stay Productive While Working From Home I wrote this as an article and thought to post this here too. What tips do you use to stay productive while working from home? \n",

      "\n",
      "# How to Stay Productive While Working From Home\n",
      "\n",
      "Working from home can be a dream. It can also be very challenging. Since the world seems to be adopting a work from home mindset, I wanted to share some tips on how to stay productive while working from home that I have found helpful over the years.\n",
      "\n",
      "## Take Time to Prepare\n",
      "\n",
      "When working from home, you must prepare for the day ahead. You don’t want to be caught like a deer in headlights when your alarm clock rings. Think about it. You are working from ‘home.’ Your home is a place of rest, relaxation, and distractions. Generally speaking, a home is not a place designed for maximum deep work and productivity – it’s a jungle.\n",
      "\n",
      "Now that we have established that our homes are a minefield of personal and professional obstacles, it is easy to see why having a plan going into your day is so important.\n",
      "\n",
      "### Start planning a day in advance\n",
      "\n",
      "Take some time at the end of your workday. Look through the tasks of the day and check off everything that you have accomplished. Now it’s time to make a new list. Write down a list of everything that you would like to do tomorrow. Make sure to include any tasks that you didn’t get around to during the day.\n",
      "\n",
      "With your list more or less completed, take a moment and think about what your day is going to looks like tomorrow. If you’d like, you can stack this process with another good habit of cleaning your desk (more on this in the next step). While thinking about the next day, you may find you need to consult with a team lead or partner. Check-in with them to see if there is anything that they might require you to do. Maybe you need to run an errand for a spouse, meet with a potential client, or start dinner a little earlier. You should have a compiled list of tasks at this point, and already a clearer picture of what the next day would look like.\n",
      "\n",
      "### Grab the Calender\n",
      "\n",
      "Take your list and sit down with your calendar. At this point, you want to try to visualize your day as best as possible. This process is not supposed to be perfect, but rather a rough outline of your day. Try to be realistic with the time it takes to complete tasks. Give yourself some leeway, and don’t expect a robot-like performance from yourself. Again, be realistic.\n",
      "\n",
      "&amp;#x200B;\n",
      "\n",
      "## Develop a Routine\n",
      "\n",
      "Similar to planning your day, a routine is there to help define boundaries for your home and office. Do you remember a time when you worked a job at an office? Chances are you had to be out of bed at a specific time; you performed a particular set of tasks to get ready and have some commute before arriving to work. While those things may have seemed like a drag at the time, they were helping you to get available for work.\n",
      "\n",
      "Once we get into the flow of a routine, often, it may seem like we are in auto-pilot mode. Slowly drifting along until arriving at our destination. A routine helps prime your brain and body for the next event. Once a set of tasks are completed, like waking up, brushing your teeth, and driving to work, your brain is ready to do the next event – usually, work.\n",
      "\n",
      "Because we work from home, you might find it a bit difficult to have a set routine. Each day is different because we are privileged (and cursed) enough to have flexibility. If you just roll out of bed and open your laptop on Monday, but only start working in the afternoon on Tuesday, you might have a difficult time trying to focus or getting in the zone when it’s time to work.\n",
      "\n",
      "### Start-Up Routine\n",
      "\n",
      "Try to set up a simple start-up routine to get into the swing of things. You have the freedom to set this routine and start at any time that best suits you. A start-up routine doesn’t have to be time-consuming, complex, and cumbersome.\n",
      "\n",
      "I am currently trying a simple routine. When I am ready to start work (which is usually more or less the same time every morning), I head out the front door for a quick 10-minute walk around my neighborhood. When I get back home, I put on some coffee and wait for it to brew while casually browsing my phone. After the coffee is ready, I pour a cup for myself and my wife and head to the office. As you can see, this is almost mimicking a commute along with grabbing a coffee before sitting down to work. I find that a 10-minute break to be alone and outside helps re-align my thoughts. It also adds some distance from myself and my home. It allows me to refresh my brain, ready to take on the workday ahead.\n",
      "\n",
      "### Shutdown Routine\n",
      "\n",
      "Similar to the start-up routine, the shutdown routine happens at the end of your day. When you’re ready to “Pack up” and go home, I’ll admit, some days, I rush out my home office and into the kitchen. But ideally, I like to first close all my browser tabs and apps on my computer. Start making a list of to-do’s for the next day, and clean my desk. If I am feeling like a groggy-zombie, I like heading outside to get some fresh air or take a quick walk around the block to clear my head.\n",
      "\n",
      "When I get back home, my brain has been reset and I am ready to spend time with my family.\n",
      "\n",
      "## Take a Breather\n",
      "\n",
      "Have you ever had a friend jealously ask you about your workday? Maybe they begrudgingly scuff at the thought of you doing an hour of work while the rest of your day is spent lounging around?\n",
      "\n",
      "This could not be farther from the truth, at least in my experience. As a remote worker, I find it incredibly easy to sit in front of my computer for a copious amount of hours at a time – not a good idea.\n",
      "\n",
      "Try taking regular breaks. While this may sound easy, it is pretty tricky to put into practice. Frequent breaks are essential to staying productive while working at home. Your body needs it, and you might find that you perform better by taking these small but frequent breathers—bonus points for having your break outside.\n",
      "\n",
      "## Work to Your Strengths.\n",
      "\n",
      "The beauty of working from home is that you have the power of flexibility at your disposal. Mostly, as long as you can get your work done promptly, companies don’t mind when and how you get your job done.\n",
      "\n",
      "If you’re an early bird, go ahead and get started nice and early. Prefer to take on your tasks like a cape crusader in the night? Why not? You might need to clarify this with your team leader, but if they say it’s all good, you’re ready to roll – whatever time suits you best.\n",
      "\n",
      "I prefer to work later in the day or even at night. My family dynamics, however, have me working closer to a standard 9 to 5 office hours kind of deal.\n",
      "\n",
      "Work to your strengths. You have the power to leverage your natural productive abilities when you feel most productive.\n",
      "\n",
      "## Try Journaling\n",
      "\n",
      "I would love to be more consistent in this regard, but I find journalling a great tool to stay productive while working from home. Journaling no matter how simple is fantastic at developing one’s self-awareness muscles. This self-awareness comes in handy when you need to realign a routine. Speak up in a meeting or know when to take a break (or push a little bit harder).\n",
      "\n",
      "### Bullet Journal\n",
      "\n",
      "I use a simple Bullet Journal method that helps me record my day’s tasks, organize my thoughts, and take note of new ideas. My bullet journal is also my anchor. If I am working, it is right by my side, ready to be flipped through and scribbled in at a moment’s notice.\n",
      "\n",
      "There are a lot of different journaling methods that can boost productivity, creativity, and personal development. I use the Bullet Journal system, but I’d encourage you to find a journaling method that best suits you.\n",
      "\n",
      "**Here are some tips to help you get started journaling:**\n",
      "\n",
      "* Don’t think you need to write pages of words a day. A simple sentence can be considered a journal entry.\n",
      "* Analog systems are incredibly satisfying to use, but your journal can be digital. There are loads of apps out there to try. If you use Mac or IOS, why not give [Apple Notes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Notes_(Apple)) a go?\n",
      "* Start simple or get creative. It’s your notebook. Do with it as you will.\n",
      "* Watch some Youtube tutorials on journalling. There are loads of ideas out there, and don’t be ashamed to copy someone else’s system. Chances are you will develop your system over time. I use the ‘Perfect Day’ system that I created myself. Let me know if you’d like me to write more about it.\n",
      "* No matter how small, go ahead, and start. You can stop anytime you want if you feel that after a few days or weeks that it’s not for you.\n",
      "\n",
      "## Give Yourself a Break.\n",
      "\n",
      "To end this article, I want to leave you with one last piece of advice. When times get tough, don’t be too hard on yourself. You will have the best intentions of making the most out of your day but it will fail. Life happens. and seemingly more so when you work from home.\n",
      "\n",
      "When this happens, try your best to recover your day as best as you can. Don’t beat yourself up. Dust yourself off and try again tomorrow. It’s going to happen, and it happens to us all who already work from home. Staying productive while working from home is tough – but you’re tougher. Get it done.\n",

      "3 Ways to Protect Morale While Working From Home It looks like we’ll be working from home for some time to come – and chances are, you are too! At Lineup, we’ve found many silver linings to working remotely. It’s easier to juggle time zone differences and easier to dial in from around the world. We didn’t skip a beat in the early weeks of stay-at-home orders, but over time we have noticed a change in company culture. Our Colorado office misses having lunch together outside, and our London office misses regular happy hours. \n",
      "\n",
      "As we’ve worked to keep relationships strong, spark creativity and boost morale, we’ve concluded that these three things are critical:  \n",
      "\n",
      "###  1. Stay Social \n",
      "\n",
      "Nothing replaces the spontaneous chit-chat of a busy office environment. We’re missing out on team lunches, last-minute brainstorm sessions, and walking meetings – but we don’t have to miss out on socialization. Research shows that having strong relationships among coworkers is massively beneficial, personally and [professionally](https://www.forbes.com/sites/jacquelynsmith/2013/09/24/how-much-coworker-socializing-is-good-for-your-career/#14bbcfc151a0).  \n",
      "\n",
      "It takes a little more effort to keep employees across different teams and departments socially connected when you’re not going into the office – but this effort can do wonders for overall employee morale. Here are some ideas: \n",
      "\n",
      "* Host regular “[Virtual Coffee Breaks](http://www.lineup.com/newsroom/25-fun-ideas-for-your-next-virtual-coffee-break/)” with specific topics of conversation and video required.  \n",
      "* Enjoy a friendly competition at the end of a workday – we did [team-wide trivia with prizes!](https://www.linkedin.com/feed/update/urn:li:activity:6668938027567525888) \n",
      "* Try a tool like [Donut](https://www.donut.com/), which connect teammates who might not otherwise chat. \n",
      "\n",
      "### 2. Be Transparent \n",
      "\n",
      "It may be tempting to de-emphasize difficult news or gloss over poor results during these unprecedented times – don’t. [Multiple studies](https://www.forbes.com/sites/williamcraig/2018/10/16/10-things-transparency-can-do-for-your-company/#5bb33ab425d0) have confirmed that transparency is a top factor in employee happiness. You may believe that by keeping bad news quiet, you’re avoiding a drop in morale, but the opposite is true.  \n",
      "\n",
      "Make transparency an integral part of your culture now, and you’ll reap rewards long after everyone is back at the office. Whether it’s being open about your [pandemic recovery strategy](https://hbr.org/2020/03/are-you-leading-through-the-crisis-or-managing-the-response), your plan for getting back to the office, or even [personal transparency](https://hbr.org/2019/02/how-leaders-can-open-up-to-their-teams-without-oversharing), make sure you’re fostering a culture of trust with every communication to your employees.  \n",
      "\n",
      "### 3. Protect Work-Life Balance \n",
      "\n",
      "Just because employees are only steps away from their desks, doesn’t mean they should always be available. When we don’t have to commute home or pick up kids or travel, it can be tempting to check your email “one last time,” or squeeze in “one last task” before bed. Of course, no one can stop your employees from doing this completely ([surveys show](https://www.timedoctor.com/blog/remote-teams-future-of-work/) that remote employees work longer hours on average). Even still, emphasizing the value of work-life balance, combating [Zoom fatigue](https://www.mindful.org/zoom-exhaustion-is-real-here-are-six-ways-to-find-balance-and-stay-connected/), and being kind to parents who are now homeschooling can do wonders for morale.  \n",
      "\n",
      "At Lineup, we’ve blocked out lunch hours for each region and asked that internal meetings not be scheduled over that time. Many of us have introduced our kids on camera, since they sometimes interrupt anyway. These small things help [bolster mental health](https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/protect-mental-health-when-remote) while we’re all physically apart and keep attitudes positive. \n",
      "('Positive', 0.7123)\n",
      "How to improve morale and be more productive while working from home? I am used to an office setting and thought I would enjoy working from home. Love the lack of commute, having more time to enjoy my own house, not having to dress as formal, etc. \n",
      "\n",
      "But, it’s been so hard for me to be as productive as I am in the office! I moved my workspace out of my bedroom and into the living room which helped a bit. Plus my team has been cut my half with the rest being furloughed so morale is low, stress is high, and our work load is bigger. \n",

      "WFH and Boundaries Let me preface this by saying I am grateful to have a job, and I am glad I have had the opportunity to work from home the past couple of months. There are many positives - the commute, the company, the dress code, and the flexibility. Work has actually helped keep me motivated and productive in a time when I needed it. The downside is I feel as though I am on call 24/7. The emails and texts do not stop at 5 and I always feel the need to respond, as well as actually work on whatever the request is. We have also been asked to drop down to a four day work week and take a vacation day every Friday for the next few weeks. Well, I am not thrilled about being forced to take time I have to earn every month to just sit at home, but what bothers me even more is the emails and texts with requests Do Not Stop on these days and they are from the people telling me I have to take the time off. We had spring break a few weeks ago and I was going to skip it because there was so much on my plate, but was told I needed to take the days off. I did, but the flow of \"Need this asap\" sure did not slack off and I recognize I am bitter about it.  OK, I guess I just wanted to vent for a minute. I am also curious about ways others set up boundaries while working from home.\n",

      "\n",
      "KPIs are met, meetings are going well...I do not see the point in working in a sterile environment, filled with distractions, freezing aircon, commuting daily 1 hour of which in winter half hour is in the dark with risk of wildlife accident, icy roads and low foggy vision. Wasting petrol and having to scrape ice off my windshield at 6.30am...just to have a coffee interaction as the rest of the work gets done much more undisrupted at home.\n",
      "\n",
      "I am now having an existential crisis, as personally the advantages of working from home just on the commute alone are massive, let alone the comfy clothes, the relaxed atmosphere, the lunches sunbathing, the soothing presence of my cat, seeing my partner a bit more. \n",
      "\n",
      "If work was penalised, as well as my productivity I would understand the necessity to going to am office 5 days a week 8-9 hours a day...but now that I’ve been doing this for a month Logic fails to justify the old routine. \n",

      "I want to talk to my boss about this and possibly lose my job at this hard time and find a more flexible  employer that will either employ me to do a job that I cannot possibly do from home or will give me the flexibility to actually work from home and allow me to live life and work within sensible terms. \n",
