Not a video chat just text. \\n\\nThere were a couple little errors in grammar during the chat that I was suspicious of, but I had also just completed a legit interview with a multi-national car manufacturer for a local on site position and I can understand having english as a second language, not everything is perfect. \\n\\nAlarm bells really started ringing when during the interview they asked if my phone carrier was pre-paid or post paid and who it was. \\n\\nThey also asked about direct deposit and who my bank was with and how long I had been a customer. Now normally I wouldn't lie in an interview but I told them it would be through one of the too big to fail banks. I figured I'd just open a new account if it turned out to be legit. I didn't even bother to answer about the time length. \\n\\nThey said they had gotten my resume online but they still needed my address. Yet another red flag. \\n\\nFinally the nuclear bomb drop was when they said they would have to send me a check to buy the equipment and would talk to me more on Monday. \\n\\nI found the website and a mention is Fast Company magazine through a google search and while it seems a real company, it still had some issues. No contact us links and no info on where HQ was. I found supposed employees on LinkedIn and one even seemed like she was in the role I had just been hired for. \\n\\nI messaged her and the poor girl had been victimized by this scam and she helped to confirm all my suspicions. \\n\\nThe company name is Cabinet Health and they are in Series B startup mode so it might be a real company. \\n\\nTL:DR: If a company interviews you through chat only, it might be a scam. If they mention sending you a check to buy equipment, it is 100% a scam.\",\n",

For the last two years, I've been allowed to WFH the majority of the time. It's been amazing for my overall mood and productivity and I love the flexibility it brings to my day. I'm very introverted and find the office environment to be draining and distracting. I've had to go into the office for about 2-3 months last year (some of that was hybrid). I was told that I needed to be there in case they needed help with clients (never happened). My office was upstairs in a corner where I was mostly left alone since no one else up there was back in the office yet. My boss informed me this week that I'll be coming back into the office next week for at least the next month and then maybe they'll think about letting me work from home a day or two a week (unlikely). Unlike last time, my office got moved downstairs so I can help out with clients, since we are going to be short a receptionist. Plus almost everyone will be back in the office, so the noise levels and interruptions will increase. We are starting up in-person client meetings and the head boss doesn't want us to use the bathroom during those times. There could be meetings anywhere from 2 to 6 hours a day! I'm so miserable at the idea of going back. I plan on job searching, but I would really appreciate any ideas on how to tell my boss that coming back into the office is untenable. When she talked to me there was no room for my feedback, as though her mind was made up even though she knows I adamantly want to WFH. Any suggestions?\",\n",

I know some introverts or people in general wish they were back in the office to socialize or whatever. If you are feeling this way then:\\n1. Work outside the home. Maybe a good ol coffee shop/restaurants\\n2. Work at a communal workspace like we work.\\n3. Invest in a portable WiFi hotspot or laptop? This is def a perk if your job helps pay or reimburse you so this is a personal finance thing\\n4. If you truly miss your coworkers, meet up with them. If they also want to work with others and aren’t weary with COVID I don’t see why people don’t meet up with their favorite coworkers\\n\\nThis is it.

We were essentially forced to come back by our senior lead who told us we need to be on-site everyday and that same first week he WFH 3 days. That was last June. My manager tells us we can’t WFH unless we have a full 8 hour day of stuff and we have to put in writing what we did that day. Putting it in writing eventually went away after about 14 meetings about it. A senior person who sucks at his job decides an hour before coming in that he’s going to WFH. My manager does it too almost every week. I’m at work now and there’s nothing going on. My manager, senior lead, and this senior person are WFH today. It’s raining here, traffic was awful, and I literally have nothing to do yet I can’t WFH. They get to sit in the comfort of their homes and chill all day. Not dealing with traffic or the rain. Yet the rest of us are here with nothing to do. I’m not complaining that there’s nothing to do since i could do some trainings but I could’ve done that from my office at home. I’m grateful to have had a job the entire pandemic and I get paid well but goddamn I feel myself declining and angry. I’m so sick of management at my job. My manager has no vision and she’s completely ignorant to our feelings about coming here everyday for no reason. I’m sure it’s not just my job either. I can’t afford a pay cut nor can I afford to just quit and live for awhile but I am goddamn close to losing my shit. Anyone in a similar situation? How do you deal with it? If you’re a manager reading this and you pull this type of nonsense just remember you have nothing without your employees and don’t treat us like we’re replaceable.

Long story short, the job posting was listed for 48hrs and had 600 applicants (I have LinkedIn premium so I saw that stat but not sure how accurate it is). I saw it at 10pm while I was mindly scrolling and planned to apply the next day but the job listing was taken down the next morning. Not wanting to miss an opportunity that would be life-changing for me I went ahead and did a deep dive into anything and everything they published and found their HR person so I went ahead and sent in my portfolio of relevant work with mock-ups using their company branding and assets (did a quick inspect of their website code and pulled relevant files) of what I could provide/improve for them. This was Saturday and I wasn\\'t expecting a response till either today or within the next couple of days, they responded to me Sunday morning. They told me they wanted to skip the first couple of steps with me and jump straight into the final interview stage which after snooping around for their interview process and their management, it\\'ll be with the president in the company and I would say they\\'re the most legit company I\\'ve ever applied for and got a response.\\n\\nI\\'ll be upfront and say I\\'m terrified and at 22 have never had a real interview in my life. I mostly freelance and with all positions I\\'ve ever \"applied\" for, I\\'ve always been told I basically had the job before I even walked in. Although this might sound like I\\'ve had it easy I don\\'t think I have. I was fortunate enough to not feel the nerves during those interviews but it was because I had already built connections with the people hiring me through networking and they already knew my capabilities.\\n\\nMy question is what should I ask him in the interview? My biggest concern is that my job requires a high performance computer and although I already have one for my freelance work. I\\'m not too keen on using it for this remote job if I have an option. To be frank, the one I have my eye on that I want to upgrade to is 6 grand but in all honesty I could probably get away with a windows machine half the price, I\\'m just an apple fanboy but I\\'ll make a reasonable decision if I have to. The thing is though, if my job expands in the direction that I\\'m hoping for, I\\'ll need much more equipment. I have all the equipment I need already on hand but the thing is the equipment I use in total costs in the range of 14-18 grand which for me is an arm and leg that took me since 18 to build up and I\\'m not too keen on using personal equipment for company work. I\\'ve had bad experiences in the past with this.

I am always above goal on my DPA (80% or above) some days I hit 90% + , my position basically consists of a lot of emails, noting accounts, excel spreadsheets, meetings, etc. No calls or customer service work. I had a rough (personal) month in February. And my work unfortunately suffered. I take full responsibility for that aspect of it. So of course my supervisor noticed. And started saying that I have these unproductive blocks of time he can track in the Verint system in the mornings. Which is confusing to me, as Verint is not able to be fooled and I am working. So if it doesn’t track idle time while I have these blocks of time that I’m not “being productive.” So I don’t understand how that’s called “unproductive,” I simply move a little slower as does anyone who I assume is not a morning person, with that being said, all my work is completed and the month of March has been good. I get all assigned tasks done, all emails replied to, all meetings attended, etc. I work very efficiently so I am always able to make up for my slower pace in the mornings by working above a normal pace in the later part of the morning and after lunch break. My supervisor put me on a correction plan for the next 3 months to “fix” my performance issues. And I’ve been on it 1 week now (first review is upcoming this Monday 4/4/22), we have weekly meetings every Monday. Which I feel is excessive. But I agreed.  \\n\\nEvery single account I have, has been noted, every spreadsheet 100% completed (which isn’t even required), every meeting attended and every email responded to in a timely manor. If not instantly. So I’m not sure why he’s using Verint tracking against me? If I look back at January, I have these same blocks of time spent longer on a web pages we use, where you can see I am moving slower (example: I spent 15-20 mins on a page vs 3-7 mins) And there was zero issues brought up by management because my accounts were up to date. Only did he notice my Verint DPA in February when my accounts weren’t being noted as often as they should have. So if my DPA % is above goal, each day, and my work is being completed. Shouldn’t that be all that matters? Not which parts of the day I am moving at a slower or faster pace? Or am I wrong for thinking that? I love my job and what I do, but the micromanaging that goes on has me wanting to find something else. \\n\\n\\nTL;DR - I am tracked on my work, I am always above goal % on the tracking system used. All my work is being completed. All emails, spreadsheets, assigned tasks, meetings, etc. I am 100% doing my job. But I do move at a slower pace in the mornings and my supervisor has noticed after a bad personal month for me where some of my work suffered. I work at an above average pace and I work very efficiently and that’s why I’m able to work slower in the mornings / faster in the afternoons and still complete all my work. Am I wrong for this? Or am I just human? This employer has been very much so micromanaging since I was hired. And my supervisor has me wanting to possibly find something else. Even though I love my position.',\n",

I started working for a company that sells medicare plans from different insurances and it's overall a very relaxed job. I have an 18month old so I have to juggle taking care of him as well but we manage and get the job done. It's hard.... but we do a good job. I was working for a well known insurance company and would receive an average of 2-3 calls every hour. This was great because sometimes I would not get a call in as long as 30-40, sometimes 50 minutes. A lot of time to get to spend with my son and overall take a breather in between calls. Two weeks ago, management told me that since it's off season there is a different department that could use my help because I'm bilingual. I wasn't given too much specifics but was told it was a good opportunity. I wasn't really given much of a choice either. This new department is requiring me to make outbound calls NON STOP all day. It's one call after the other with 1-2 minute breaks in between. The majority of these calls are voicemails but it is a drastic switch compared to what I was used to. I am completely overwhelmed to say the least. Mind you, I was NOT given a pay increase and when I brought it up to HR I was pretty much told if I'm not happy about being switched departments then to let them know so they can pretty much let me go. I feel undervalued as an employee because I wasn't given a pay increase and I also am not happy at all with this new positions tasks. I'm so incredibly grateful I have a stay at home job and get to be with my son, but having this new position leaves me with absolutely no time to even breathe. I'm literally not sure what to even do since HR has already left me with a bad taste in my mouth.\",\n",

No matter what route they choose, it is important to be organized and stay focused on their goals. With a little hard work and determination, stay-at-home moms can make money and still take care of their families.',\n",

       " 156: {'text': \"Work from Home Manifesto I have worked the last 2 years at home, having just started a new position before going home for COVID. This has been the best 2 years of my life. Being able to spend this much time with my family and seeing my kids grow up. I wouldn’t trade it for the world. Going back to the office was always inevitable. My company has never changed their tune, and I understand their opinion and decision. My company hasn’t changed, but I have. I have changed opinion not only because of my family, but I’ve also changed my opinion on what is the most effective way to do my job. Not only have I enjoyed working from home to be around my family, I have been able to focus more on my work. I have developed more, I have learned more, and I am more effective on a daily basis. More than I can be driving into the office.\\n\\nI know some have a different opinion that there is an invaluable experience in working in an office and collaborating with others. I personally don’t know if I believe this or not. I don’t know if I’d have the skills I have today, having worked in an office for this long. Maybe I wouldn’t have learned and grown as much. Or maybe like the last 2 years, I would have learned and grown faster. I do know that the majority of people saying you need to be in the office, also have power over people in the office and they have the biggest desks, and offices with doors. Maybe they’ve spent so much time and energy acquiring this office stature that they don’t want to lose that?\\n\\nI know some are saying just suck it up and be a man, or woman. Be a man, or woman, and just drive into work. I believe a man, or woman, should suck it up and go to work, and provide for their family. The question is what does your job entail? Are you driving to work in a cubicle farm because you think that’s the profitable thing for the company? If you’re like me and believe you're more profitable for the company when you’re working from home, then you’re just driving to the cubicle farm for your boss. You are being your boss’ bitch. Then you’re going around calling others childish.\\n\\nIn conclusion I’ve poured a lot of time and effort into doing a great job for my company the last 2 years. Now I feel like I’m asked to drive in (take a pay cut). Give up time at home. And perform my job less effectively. Who’s winning? The person in the big office probably sleeps better, I hope the power trip improves their sex too.\",\n",

But when I started, NO ONE worked from home and it turned out I was the only one who had the hybrid set-up.

I am a 43 year old guy who is looking to do a career pivot/change occupations.  \\n\\n\\nI have an Associates of Applied Science degree in Computer-Aided Drafting and Design from the Pennsylvania College of Technology.  I graduated back in '99.  I've been working as a drafter my entire career.....19 years and now another 3 years between two major kitchen cabinet production companies.  \\n\\n\\nI have a wife and a 10 year old daughter.  My wife is a teacher, so both she and my daughter get the summers off.  \\n\\n\\nWe recently paid off our home, our vehicles, we have a great college fund set up for my daughter, etc...so we've dropped a ton of our monthly payments recently.  \\n\\n\\nAlthough I've been a drafter/engineer my entire career, I've always had more of a knack for creative arts than technical applications.  I love to write, love videography/photography, etc...  \\n\\n\\nI'm trying to decide what's next in my journey.  Money isn't as important at this stage in my life.  Part of the problem with the jobs I have been doing is that they require a LOT of overtime.    \\n\\n\\nI'd rather have a part-time job doing something I love instead of working long hours, away from my family.  Being able to work from home during the pandemic was a definite help.  And with gas prices the way they currently are, I'm ready to ditch the daily commute.  \\n\\n\\nI am contemplating enrolling/completing some online classes to help.  I could see earning a certificate up to possibly another associate's degree in a new field.  A bachelor's degree is probably out of reach, at least for now.    \\n\\n\\nI still need to be able to provide a somewhat steady income for my family, even if it is less than what I'm used to.  I basically paid for our house in all the over time I've worked in the past 22 years, so I kind of feel like I should be allowed some downtime/working only part-time until I figure things out.  My plan is to take this summer off from work and hopefully have a clearer picture by then.  \\n\\n\\nMy current thoughts are something in the graphic design/web-design/videography spectrum.  \\n\\n\\nI don't mind entry-level work.  In fact, I think I'd be happiest with a low-stress, 24-32 hour/flexible hours job, where I can spend more time with my family, especially in the summers.  Working from home would be perfect as well!  \\n\\n\\nAny suggestions?    \\n\\n\\nThanks!\",\n",

So I’m looking for advice and tips on how to transition. \\n\\nNo young kids at home, three dogs that are almost as needy. As for space, I am debating between a large room in the basement that is well lit, egress window, it’s own bath and walkout door/patio. I used it during early weeks of pandemic. It has workout equipment as well but has plenty of room for both home office and workout space. Also has a bathroom. Second option is guest bedroom which is more separate and is smaller. Think regular size 12x12 bedroom that I would have to put a desk in a corner. Good lighting, fantastic windows.',\n",

My job has a chat department, and my manager knows I’m interested, but I keep getting the run around, and they want 90% adherence every month, which isn’t retainable; and they still make people from that department hop on the phones every now and then. I’ve applied for several email/chat positions over the past few days; and I’ve gotten a few rejection letters, but other than that I haven’t heard anything back. I do go to therapy, but it doesn’t do a lot lately, because I know what my main cause of stress is. After I leave this job, I don’t ever plan on working in another call center again. I deal with social anxiety and although its gotten better, I’m not ready to go back to a face to face customer position (I also don’t have a car anymore). I deal with a visual-spatial learning disability, so it makes the kinds of jobs I can do very limited. I really could use some advice on what my next steps should be, because I really see myself quitting during one of my shifts, and running the risk of being evicted out of my apartment, since I don’t have another job lined up.',\n",

I\\'m on my phone...\\n\\n\\nI\\'ve been working for a telecommunications company for some time now and this company has a ton of clients. A lot of us have been with the company long enough to be passed around quite often from client to client just to stay working. Needless to say, when you\\'re  constantly changing clients of course your managers and other leaders change. And with that comes different managing styles. I\\'ve had really awesome managers and some that are crap so now whenever I\\'m told I have to move or there will be a new manager I start to get anxious. \\n\\nThis leads me to the point of my post. So I just recently change campaigns again and my new manager is basically never available. To be honest almost none of the managers are ever available unless they need something from you. We reach out constantly to management for things that only they can make decisions about or have the answers for and they completely ignore us. So we are left with no guidance or resources to do our job correctly. They change processes and don\\'t communicate it to us or if they do they don\\'t tell us how we are to do it. Just left with no directions on how they want it done.The biggest problem is we are also left to have to reach out to tenured staff for guidance or to each other and its basically like the blind leading the blind. Different people not getting the guidance they need and are finding work arounds just to get the job done for the client. We have complained constantly about the lack of communication to our bosses and to each other. Some of the excuses we get is that they are busy. They don\\'t read emails and don\\'t answer back to messages. Almost never respond to anything and if they do respond you\\'re met with a \"what?\" Or them giving you a partial answer. You may have a full list detailing what you need from them and explanations why. I\\'ve tried to make my emails as organized and as clear and easy to read as possible. But still they are half assed read or not read at all. And of course little to no response given.\\n\\nWhich brings me to the next issue. My assistant manager had the AUDACITY... after they and my manager does not read or respond to our messages to yell in meetings about expectations not being met. And shit is don\\'t incorrectly. We are literally working off of no guidance at all and left to figure things out or to try to ask for help and pray the people you ask knows. This has happened to me on more than one occasion where I was berated and yelled at for not knowing or not doing something or doing it incorrectly. I finally had a meltdown the last time and flipped out and told them how am I supposed to know and you\\'re not communicating or giving us access to resources. There are things you know and have but you are not sharing with the team unless you have \"time\" to so naturally there are gaps in our knowledge.\\n\\n\\nSo fast forward to the most recent meeting my POS manager says. The reason why I do what I do in not \"giving you the answers\" is that I want to see what you know. I want to see your mind work. I want to know if you are going to come to me or are you going to seek at the information from your peers or on your own. They stated that their ultimate goal is to make the team as self sufficient as possible. And while I understand what they say are trying to do. I think they are full of shit. I think they don\\'t want to be bothered and this is the best answer that they can give. Because they set these expectations and do not give the proper guidance and resources to even find the answer on our own. The team is suffering.  The client is unhappy. They are getting in trouble and then they point the blame at us and pull us into meetings and call us out and end up berating us on why shit is fucked up and wrong. Or ask what is going on with something we already sent emails and constant messages and reminders about but they failed to respond, come to a decision, or guide us on what they would like us to do. We are always left to rely on co workers who don\\'t know much more than we know. \\n\\n\\nI just want to understand and am asking for those of you who have had managerial positions or education. Or even those who have worked for a manager like this. Is this normal? Is our team the ones that are incompetent and need to step it up? And how do we get to a better understanding? Cause whatever the hell we have going on that is ruining everything.',\n",

Also, so far neither job has mentioned anything about non-compete clauses, but they both know I’m not working. \\n\\n  Both positions want me to be available ~8:30-5. 8hrs for each position. First has mandatory OT during busy times (it’s in the tax field) Second has Monday meetings at 9:30am. Both allow me to work whenever as long as the work is done, but I do need to be available during the day hours to respond to clients and to verify info for the first. \\n\\n  My take on it is that many people have ft and pt jobs, when neither know about the other.

       " 382: {'text': \"An uncommon guide to becoming a digital nomad: Or how to get a remote work job in 3 weeks  Hey Y’all!\\n\\nDiscovered this subreddit last month and have been loving it! I’ve been a remote worker for 3yrs now and never imagined the community being so large on Reddit. Feel like I found a secret tribe! I figured I better contribute something to the workfromhome community as I’ve been stealing ideas and inspiration from everyone else. So, I created a little guide about the process I use to get remote work jobs in just 3 weeks as I know there are some people on here who are probably dreaming about becoming a remote worker (as I once was) and are not sure how to get started. The usual “start your own business” advice can seem daunting and out of many comfort zones, as it was mine, so this will focus on the process of getting *employee* remote work positions. If you already are a remote worker then this post won’t be for you- but for those looking to get “in the game” then I’m positive you’ll be able to pick up something of value to use on your journey!\\n\\nHowever, I hope you find something of value in this write-up regardless of what level you are at. I figure if you’re on the workfromhome subreddit then you already have a degree of knowledge on the subject. The list below should help you get started if you’ve been lurking or help you shift professions if you’re looking for a career pivot. Either way enjoy and feel free to message me on [Instagram ](http://instagram.com/corybeardsley_)if you have any questions at **corybeardsley\\\\_** . I’d be happy to help! I know how difficult this process was when I first started and how much I could’ve used someone so don’t hesitate to slide into my dm’s lol. I’m only signed into reddit on my computer so I don’t typically see messages for a bit but I’ll try to stick around for the day and answer any questions in the chat. Cheers!\\n\\nAlso, there are many ways to get a remote work job. This is just one of them. It’s not the fastest, best, or easiest. It’s just the way I’ve learned to go about it over the last two years and I’ve tried to condense it enough to fit on one page but sadly got a little carried away lol.\\n\\n&amp;#x200B;\\n\\n1. **Cover Letters**: Although some sites do still ask you to attach a cover letter file, most just have a section for you to type out your cover letter or state why you’re a good fit. My go-to template is: *Hey! Love what’s being done at (Company). (1 line to show you’ve at least Googled the company). Although I do have {job title or similar past role} experience, I understand that you get a lot of applicants and I don’t have years of experience, but I am so confident that this is a great fit that I am willing to do a one week trial period to show that I can handle the responsibilities of the role. If after a week you decide it’s not a great fit, I’d understand. Nothing to lose and either way you get a free week of work. If you’re interested you can reach out to {Email} for a quick reply!”*. No one has ever taken me up on the offer of a free trial. It’s just used to stand out quickly and get my foot in the door for a first round interview. Once I started using this cover letter template my interview requests jumped nearly 300% in a week (4 to 12).\\n2. **Portfolio Site**: A key mental shift to adopt is that we are not trying to get a remote work job, we are trying to get *interviews* for a remote work job. A subtle but important perspective shift. The most underutilized way to do so? Portfolio Sites. You can create one for free by going to [WordPress.com](https://wordpress.com/). My site template is an opening *About Me* page which is very relaxed. I then include a *Projects* section, an *Experience* section, and a *My Approach* section. The *Projects* section includes two projects I worked on, whether personal or career based. *Experience* is a further elaboration on the 2-3 jobs listed on my resume including testimonials (more below) and the *My Approach* page is a video where I talk about time-management principles like Pareto &amp; Parkinson’s law for two minutes. This is so the hiring manager can see me “live” and helps speed up the dating process. In the onboarding process for [WordPress](https://wordpress.com/) I always select build (NOT store or write) and use my first &amp; last name for site title &amp; address. For themes I use Independent Publisher 2 and include a stock sunset pic for my header image alongside a gravatar (free with WordPress) which is the same image used across platforms (LinkedIn/Resume). If you don’t know how to build a website there are plenty of great videos detailing the process on YouTube, like this [one](https://youtu.be/TafbP_vOGN0). However, if you’re tech savvy enough (which you probably are if you’re on this subreddit) you can create one solo! \\n\\nhttps://preview.redd.it/xh0gubzkc6l81.png?width=669&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=6201cac9b708ac28e23600410e7a686e591de7fb\\n\\n1. **Resume (Visual CV)**: I always create a resume through [VisualCV](https://www.visualcv.com/es/) that I have linked out to the various pages on my portfolio site. VisualCV has a multitude of templates and also allows you to track data to see how many people viewed your resume and which links they clicked. They used to offer one free resume, but if that’s no longer the case it costs $18 for unlimited resumes. I use a standard experience/education combo for the thick of it, but also throw in a headshot and a sidebar that links out directly to the project pages on my portfolio site. You can create a linkable resume for free through Google Docs as well, although more difficult. The key is to have direct links to your portfolio site. \\n2. **Applications (FlexJobs)**: LinkedIn. Indeed. Ziprecruiter. All great sites for exploring the remote job market and are used by millions of people worldwide. LinkedIn even has a feature now that allows you to search exclusively for remote work positions! How great! F\\\\*\\\\*\\\\* that noise. There’s only one site you need and it’s [*FlexJobs*](https://www.flexjobs.com/). I’m astonished this isn’t listed on every remote work guide. I have a borderline unnatural love for this app. What it does is scans through and verifies remote work jobs across the globe and uploads them to their site. From there you can create a search criteria that helps you find jobs aligned within your industry and preference. They have a bunch of bonus features too and will send a gift package once you get your job. In my experience, the majority of jobs that meet my criteria on the initially listed trio of career sites have been pyramid schemes, insurance hustles, or straight scams. FlexJobs saves you from having to validate each listing and prevents you from sending out useless applications. Full disclosure it does cost money ($10week/$15mth/$60yr) but it’s like having a VA for your job hunt and is well worth the cost. \\n3. **Interviews**: I always create a resume-review monologue that I place in a Google Doc that I reuse for all my interviews. I split the screen between the document (about 1 page) and video chat when the interview starts. Having the interviewer appear smaller on my screen oddly calms me down and having the monologue ready helps save time in the preparation process. I adjust it slightly for each position to include key industry jargon and words directly used in the job posting but nothing more than a sentence or two. I also come prepared with a canned question to ask at the end which is a version of: *“You’ve actually done a great job explaining the role and answered all my questions here. I guess the only one I’m left with is whether it be me, or someone else, what would you like to see in the next 3-6 months to know you’ve made the right hire for the role”*. If it’s only the first round interview I typically pocket the question and transition to a version of “I’ve had a great time discussing the role and look forward to next steps” closer. Other than that I just spend an hour the night before reviewing the company's social media accounts to prepare. \\n4. **LinkedIn:** You can learn to set one up [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qG4NF-2tt4c). I recommend having 500 connections. Once you get over 500 it stops tallying and appears simply as a 500+ which is further social proof to validate your online presence. Social proof and online validation is key when applying for a remote position and submitting your LinkedIn profile is often required for many job applications. To build up your network simply fill out your profile and go to the *my network* tab on the site. From there just click connect on *all* recommendations. 99% will not message you but if you want to reach out to specific people by all means go for it! Another way to leverage LinkedIn is to visit the profile page of companies you may be interested in working for and going to the *peoples* section. You can look for recruiters, talent acquisition, or hiring managers and connect with them. You can then message to set up a “time to talk” about a *specific* role, not a vague “position”. To find a specific role you can go to the company's LinkedIn profile under *jobs*. Also, you may encounter an individual you are interested in connecting with that does not have a connect option under their profile. To bypass this go to their page and select more. A new pop up will appear and you can select connect from there. \\n5. **Testimonials**: Getting testimonials on your website or LinkedIn is one of the best forms of content to have in your remote-work job hunt. You can add in testimonials to the relevant experience sections of your portfolio site and include them on your LinkedIn profile as well. To request a testimonial from an individual on Linkedin go to their profile, select more, and click request recommendation. The template I use to ask for testimonial requests is: *Hi {first name}! Loved working with you and hope you're still enjoying your time at {company}. I’m reaching out because I’m applying for a full-time remote work position and am wondering if you could write a sentence or two about your experience working with me. If not, no worries, I totally understand if you’re too busy but even a one- or two- line reply would really make my day. Best- Cory.* Testimonials from LinkedIn can be copied into your portfolio site as well.\\n\\n&amp;#x200B;\\n\\nhttps://preview.redd.it/8199rw8mc6l81.jpg?width=624&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=4bf4699dfd1d2c28ede07ed39f704dc795c9709f\\n\\n&amp;#x200B;\\n\\nHope you found something of value in there! If you did it is less so due to any perceived intelligence that I may possess and more to do with the months of rejection I endured early on. It sucked- and I hope that this guide speeds up your process so you don’t have to endure the same. Feel free to adjust every template to better fit your voice and if you have any questions feel free to message me on [Instagram](http://instagram.com/corybeardsley_)! Wish y’all the best! \\n\\nCheers - Cory.\",\n",

Leave it to me, I get started in the waning hours - that's when the panic monkey seems to awaken.\\n\\nWe received an email informing us to expect to start back to work starting next week, at least 1x per week.\\n\\nI'd like to rebuke this mandate with well thought out and coherent counter points.  I'm not in a position where I can walk away from the job if they require going in, but it wont prevent me from looking around at other similarly-situated jobs.  I'm valued, but as we all know, not irreplaceable - so it's not like they're going to cave if I threaten to walk anyway.\\n\\nSo far, the most direct counters to return to the office I can think of are:\\n\\na) TIME (as we're all well aware) - commuting anywhere from 2 to 4 hours a day add up real quick over the course of a week.\\n\\nb) COST - wear and tear on the vehicles, bus passes, wardrobe, meals.\\n\\nbut these aren't benefits to the company.  They're just the 'cost of doing business' for the employee.  \\n\\nWhat type of benefits would the employer enjoy by maintaining working from home?\\n\\na) Increased Productivity / Longer Hours on the job (we've all done it) - many of which are unpaid (salaried employee).  I know i'm not trying to race for a train at any particular time.\\n\\nb) Better product - I have personally invested in software to be run on my home computers which are better at processing than the relics provided at the job.  I would have to spend time building justifications for software which would take time away from actually performing the function if i just went out and bought the equipment myself.\\n\\nc) Smaller Footprint - Mostly sunk costs, however the cost for equipment/supplies MUST HAVE decreased over the course of WFH\\n\\nd) more/better/digital documentation since more correspondence must be communicated via email/messenger.\\n\\ne) more impromptu meetings since there are no waiting around for meeting rooms, they're just all virtual meeting spaces (metaverse!).  \\n\\nf) fewer leave hours used as more people can work around the issues that would otherwise keep them out of the office\\n\\ng) I'm not sure if this translates into lowered cost of benefits, but it might - anyone have any idea?\\n\\nOk, at this point i'm grasping at straws.

My company, which is in the travel industry, has been great at keeping us working during this travel drought. A few of the newer hires did have to get let go a few months into the pandemic and we did have to go to a 32-hour work week with partial unemployment, but we were able to keep busy with other tasks and work from home.\\n\\nStarting next month, we will be returning to a full 40-hour work week and also transitioning into a hybrid work environment where we work 3 days in the office and 2 days at home (or all 5 days in the office if that's what we prefer). Our boss was always against working from home because he likes everyone to be together to collaborate. However, this pandemic made him realize that we really CAN work fine from home. We've all come up with new ways to work from home. No more printing out things and everything is digital. But we can't convince him to keep everyone working from home. Some employees, if they have wanted to, have been able to come into the office and work if that's what they prefer for the past 6 months or so. Some do prefer coming in if they have too many distractions at home. However, the majority would prefer to stay at home.\\n\\nThere are 2 huge benefits to working from home. First, I have about a 40-minute commute both ways--and that's if the traffic is good. Some days it may take me 1 1/2 hours to get home. That's 2 hours of travel time where I could be working instead. Second, the price of gas is over $4/gallon here. I'll have to fill up once a week with travelling to work whereas now I fill up maybe once a month.\\n\\nOur boss lives a 10-minute walk from the office so he doesn't realize the amount spent on gas and the time commuting. It really seems silly to go in when we work perfectly fine from home. I can see coming in for meetings or when we really do need to sit down with others and work things out, but frankly I get MORE distracted at work due to others talking and people coming in and out than I do at home!\\n\\nWho else feel this way?\",\n",

I don’t live with my boyfriend and I normally work from home at my own house. I live in an area that occasionally has very bad flooding. Last week, I brought my work from home laptop with me to my boyfriend’s house on Sunday evening, because I was worried my road was about to flood and I wouldn’t be able to get home in the morning. The next day my road flooded so I worked from my boyfriend’s house for the next 3 days.\\n\\nI mentioned in a casual phone conversation with a coworker that I was flooded out of my house and working at my boyfriend’s place. She then tattled on me to my manager, who called me today (over a week later) to reprimand me for working at my boyfriend’s house. She said I should have notified her and that it’s company equipment and something could have happened. She said I was only supposed to be working from my house. I’m not sure how she thinks I would have damaged my laptop simply by moving it to a different location. \\n\\nI was also surprised, because I didn’t think this would be an issue. Also I already signed a contract when I started working that stated if I damaged the work laptop I would be responsible for paying for it.\\n\\nThis isn’t the first time I’ve worked from my boyfriend’s house, I do it occasionally when there is a snowstorm. The first time I did it, I mentioned it to an IT guy and he didn’t say anything about it not being allowed.\\n\\nI’m now worried my boss is somehow going to find out I’ve done this more than once and I’m going to be fired. I didn’t think working at someone else’s house for a few days was a big deal.

When you cry into your own hands and wonder why life is hard, you are definitely not alone.\\n\\nBut despite the slow pain, people are slowly beginning to realize that many of the bad things that are happening to us are not really happening to us, these are the things that are happening.\\n\\nIt is our negative attitude or inclination that makes neutral situations something full of despair and anger, confusion and frustration.\\n\\n1) You are greedy.\\n\\nOops, a way to touch the earth, right? If you are too selfish, you may find that life is harder than people who are likely to give away to others.\\n\\nWe don\\'t mean that you should save a small country from starvation or donate a shirt to someone from behind, but it\\'s nice to look at others from time to time to get your attention.\\n\\nIf you do not focus your attention, say the poor, hungry people in the aforementioned small country, you will realize how good your own life is and it will help you to be grateful for what is in your life.\\n\\nWhen we exercise gratitude, we are not only grateful to the universe for everything we have, but we are grateful for life in general. It makes life much less, believe us. 2) You are a hypocrite.\\n\\nIf you are a person who thinks he lives and dies according to his word, but then returns to his word, to himself or to someone you know, then you will find that life is not as fun as it could be. .\\n\\nThe main reason why people return their word is inconvenience. We thought we would lose 10 pounds in the new year, but it was really hard.\\n\\nHonestly, it\\'s never been so hard. Sadly, there are thoughts we have about losing 10 pounds. Losing 10 pounds is neutral. You say you do something and then you don\\'t.\\n\\nIt makes life harder than it should be.\\n\\nIf you do the things you say you will do, you will live an easier life, even if it will sometimes be uncomfortable. 3) We are not as free as we think.\\n\\nWhile people want to pursue the idea of \\u200b\\u200bfreedom of choice, the reality is that many factors play a role in our decision-making and life choices.\\n\\nWe don\\'t even know many of them.\\n\\nThink, for example, of the stories your parents tell you about your home: do you also believe that a teenager in a small town on Friday night can do nothing but break down cars?\\n\\nIs it a story you believe in, or is it a story you grew up in and it was never hard to ask? We carry a lot of information that is not in our own minds, but we accept it as a reality of our lives.\\n\\nThese thoughts always determine how we make decisions and how we live our lives. \"I can\\'t find another job.\" So not this way.\\n\\nWhen you examine what you think and feel, you may find that your freedom of choice is threatened by a life of information coming from all directions.\\n\\n4) You do not bear any responsibility. I think taking responsibility is the strongest virtue we can gain in life.\\n\\nBecause the reality is that YOU are ultimately responsible for everything that happens in your life, including your joys and sorrows, successes and failures, and the quality of your relationships.\\n\\nHowever, the cruel lesson of life is that some people take responsibility for their lives. They prefer to blame other people and become victims. And that\\'s why life remains difficult for them. I will share with you for a moment how my responsibility has changed my own life.\\n\\nDid you know that 6 years ago I was scared, lousy and worked in a warehouse every day?\\n\\nI got stuck in a hopeless circle and had no idea how to get out of it.\\n\\nMy solution was to remove my victim mentality and take personal responsibility for everything in my life. I wrote about my journey here. Fast forward today and my Hack Spirit website helps millions of people make radical changes in their own lives. We have become one of the largest websites in the world about mindfulness and practical psychology.\\n\\nIt\\'s not about bragging, it\\'s about showing how powerful it is to take responsibility ...\\n\\n... Because you too can change your own life by owning it completely.\\n\\nTo help you with this, I worked with my brother Justin Brown to create an online personal responsibility workshop. Check it out here. We provide you with a unique framework for finding your best self and realizing powerful things.\\n\\nIt soon became Ideapod\\'s most popular workshop.\\n\\nIf you want to have control over your life like I did 6 years ago, then this is the online resource you need.\\n\\n5) Babies.\\n\\nAt the end of the day, no matter how hard you work, someone else is waiting on your wings to break your bell. The big burden of life is that we cannot control other people. We can only control how we feel and how we react to neutral circumstances that come our way.\\n\\nThe circumstance remains neutral until we assign a value to them and blow them away disproportionately.\\n\\nImagine that next time you meet someone you don\\'t like: a person you don\\'t like, or things he does?\\n\\nIt can help you see them differently and allow them to enter the present.

Basically, it\\'s money that you consistently make without doing anything and anything. Of course, you have to spend a lot of work in the beginning, but once you set the flow of passive income, you can sit idly by and enjoy the fruits of your hard work. Here are some ideas:\\n\\nWriting a book. Writing a book means that you make money from the sale when you publish it. You can always go for the e-book option and publish it yourself, or try to find a publisher who will take you.\\n\\nCreate an application. Create a smartphone app and make money every time someone downloads it. You never know what will become viral and how easily you can make money if your app hits. In fact, the crazy iFart app even generated $ 30,000 in a single day. Create a static blog. Take the time to create a website in an area that interests you and other people. Focus on topics that have never been dated (\"how to\" articles are pretty green) that you know people will find. Host ads on your site. Once you have good content on your site, you can stop writing and make money on your old content. Write articles online. You can make money if you are approved as a Dotdash writer. The first two years you get paid to write articles. Then you will be paid according to the pages on the site. If you have already made the first attempt to write an article, you can only make money in the observations in the coming years. Make a video on YouTube. Make a video for YouTube, and if your video becomes popular, you can run ads and make money. The amount you earn varies, but many people, like Justin Bieber, run races and favorite youtubers get more than six or seven numbers.\\n\\nTake beautiful photos. If you have an eye and a passion for photography, sell your photos on sites like Shutterstock - a place where amateur photographers can sell their photos. For each downloaded image, you will receive a commission ranging from 25 cents to $ 75 or more. There are other similar sites like iStockphoto, so be sure to do your research and choose the one that is best for you.\\n\\nDraw and design graphics. Photo websites also accept illustrations and graphics. You can still make money every time you download. Make a t-shirt. Design a T-shirt for Threadless, and if your design is popular in the web community, the company will use your designs for another Threadless T-shirt. Once your proposal is selected, you can earn thousands of dollars in rewards and reprints. You can also design and sell T-shirts or other products on sites like Zazzle, Cafe Press and Society6.\\n\\nInsurance sales. When you sell insurance, not only do you make money when you close a deal, but other companies also give you an extra commission when your customer renews their insurance.\\n\\nEarn stock dividends. One of the most common ways to earn a passive income is to invest in stocks that pay high dividends. Here is a list of some paying stocks that have high prices.\\n\\n* [**Get Paid To Take Photos, Start Selling Your Photos Today**](https://linktr.ee/thedigitalreviews)\\n* [**Online Social Media Jobs That Pay $25 - $50 Per Hour.

But when it comes to finding it, it's often difficult for us to get to it in a matter of days. Therefore, people who are interested in earning $ 500 or more can set a more realistic goal, such as a week or more.\\n\\nThis will help them really talk about the path they want to go, instead of investing their time without finding a solution. Here we will discuss some more realistic ways to make money on a short schedule. 1. Conduct online surveys\\n\\nDid you know that online surveys can make you a lot of money? Well, now you know!\\n\\nWhen we think about the Internet today, we are only attacked by social media. But the internet can also be a great place to make money if you look in the right direction. Students, researchers and organizers from all over the world need surveys to study. To persuade people to give the right answers, they always give them money. The best part is that you can get free money at your home. Registering on this site is easy and does not require your money.\\n\\nOne of the most popular online surveying sites is Survey Junkie. Their surveys are short and you can easily answer multiple surveys in one day. The money you earn by completing the surveys will be transferred to your PayPal account. You can blindly trust them because they have been working in the industry for a long time and have a 4-star rating with lots of positive reviews!\\n\\nIf you do not want rewards in the form of cash, then you have the option of obtaining them in the form of Amazon or Target gift cards. Anyone interested in getting free money can definitely sign up for all these high-paying research platforms and earn $ 500 quickly in a matter of weeks.\\n\\n2. Make freelance corrections\\n\\nDo you have an eagle sight that naturally sees and corrects mistakes? Do you want that freedom and flexibility above all?\\n\\nI have good news: It can be fixed.\\n\\nIn this online world, there is always a constant need for proofreaders. You also don't have to pay or invest in any of them. If you have the necessary skills and knowledge to gain clients, you can definitely enter this field without any investment. However, if you are new and have little or no knowledge on how to get started, I encourage you to sign up for this FREE 76-minute workshop - find out everything you need to know to be a successful proofreader that you are at home.\\n\\n3. Be a fully occupied VA\\n\\nIn today's world - one of the best ways to build long-term, sustainable and profitable income from home is to offer virtual assistant services.\\n\\nThere are many directions you can take and many things you can do about it, depending on your background, skills and interests. There is literally something for everyone and you can create a business that does what you are good at, what you love and what is best you love - working with the people you love. work (not for!). However, I have found that while many people have heard of VA, or even of the concept of freelance in general, they do not know where and how to start.\\n\\nI had the honor of watching my friend Gina Horkey change from a freelance writer to a thriving virtual assistant online entrepreneur for many years. His leap into the world of virtual assistance - and teaching others how to do what he did - has literally changed the lives of thousands of people.\\n\\n4. Get Strange Rabbit Jobs\\n\\nDo you think that you can earn up to $ 500 by accepting strange jobs? People are usually lucky enough to make money when they have a job in their neighborhood. With the advent of the Internet, it has become easier. A website like Task Rabbit lets you find a job and finish it without having to knock on any door in your area.\\n\\nThere are many projects, from cleaning the bathroom to assembling a piece of furniture to help you with your garden.\\n\\nExplore your skills or talents so that you can effectively help one's task. All one has to do is state the task one wants to accomplish.\\n\\nOnce you register as a to-do list, the person goes through the list and selects the one that matches their task. If they choose you, you should try them and finish the job.\\n\\nThe site contains a list of taskers from various states across the United States. So if you are interested in being a part of it, do not hesitate to log on to the website. 5. Find a job in your area\\n\\nWhy don't you go look for work nearby? If you are a teenager or a student, you can try to find work and activities in your area.\\n\\nIt is likely that some households need help. You can help her deliver food, take care of her children or even walk the dog. Are you ready to work in your spare time and at peak times to maximize your income?\\n\\n* [**Get Paid To Take Photos, Start Selling Your Photos Today**](https://linktr.ee/thedigitalreviews)\\n* [**Online Social Media Jobs That Pay $25 - $50 Per Hour.

My \"office\" will be in the corner between the (just for show, non-working) fireplace and the loveseat. I\\'m trying to decide how to set up my area though. I\\'m getting an L shaped desk to fit here, but I can\\'t decide *how* I should fit it there. I can push the loveseat and chair more toward the stairs, but they can\\'t be right against them (I have two toddlers who are climbers and WILL go over the bannister, so we need enough space between the stairs and chair to have a buffer). My problem is the windows. The sliding door and window above the loveseat both let in a lot of light. I thought about putting my computer on the 59\" wall, but I don\\'t want glare. I also thought about putting it on the 48\" wall and just keeping the blinds over the sliding door closed if it\\'s causing glare, but I also don\\'t want to end up with a headache from the sun in my face as I\\'m working. I\\'m apprehensive to put the computer anywhere on the desk that\\'s not against a wall (see reference to toddlers). The whole area will be blocked off with a baby gate when the kids are home, but, again, they\\'re climbers and are known to shake the baby gate and try to push it down. \\n\\n&amp;#x200B;\\n\\nThe other question I have is lighting. It gets very dark in here, especially in the afternoon (window on long wall is facing west, window in dining room is blocked by a tree). We have no overhead lighting in the living room area (we rent, so installing lighting isn\\'t an option), so I need some sort of free-standing lighting. I\\'m torn between a floor lamp or a desk-lamp, so I just figured I\\'d get opinions on that too. What do you all think?\\n\\n&amp;#x200B;\\n\\nI should also add, this is a temporary solution. We are moving in about 6 months, so I will be able to set up better. I start a new job on Monday though that\\'s FT WFH, so I need some sort of setup to get me through until we move, but it has to have enough space for everything (hence the L shape desk).\\n\\nhttps://preview.redd.it/imjs57ca7nj81.jpg?width=2060&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=eafbae6dfcb7f760dee3ba378e8e9ff8833d7361',\n",

On the same desk, I have another monitor for my PC which I use for side gigs, art, and gaming. The monitors are all about 30 inches, so I’m essentially staring at a wall of screens at all times. I also have to use the same desk to store my more portable tech (laptop and iPad) and my art gear/office supplies (drawing tablet) When I use those, I have to push my stuff aside.\\n\\nI’m overwhelmed. I live with my parents and I have to combine all of my personal items in my 10x10 room and a storage unit I rent. In an ideal world, I’d down size my bed and get rid of my makeup table just to get a little sanity back but I don’t technically own it or any of the furniture in my room aside from tech, so I don’t have a say in whether it goes. I *just* managed to convince my parents to let me pay to redo my closet so it’s actually usable for storage. I’ve tried talking about allowing me to go into another room, but my mom is adamant I only work in my room, even if she’s out of the house for half the year. \\n\\nIt’s gotten so bad I seriously considered moving out but I don’t make enough money to do it with inflation and how bad my local market is. Plus, I wouldn’t be able to bring my dog, who’s the only reason I’m able to put up with everything going on right now.\\n\\nWith all that being said, does anyone have experience with trying to fit an office in already crowded room?',\n",

I\\'m not opposed to going in, but I have a problem that\\'s unique at my office: I was given The Heavy Laptop.\\n\\nI\\'m a software developer at a small tech company. A lot of people in the office are on Macbooks and do their Windows stuff in a Windows VM. My laptop is a HP ZBook 17 which just runs Windows, which I prefer as I\\'ve never used a VM and don\\'t feel like troubleshooting one, especially while mostly remote. I was given it because when I joined the company in mid-2019, someone had just left and this was the laptop they had spare. At the time, we joked about how ludicrously heavy it is, but it didn\\'t matter because we were in the office and I only had to carry it about five yards between my desk and my locker.\\n\\nAdvantages: I\\'m told it\\'s more powerful than the laptops issued to other devs (I don\\'t know what exact spec they have), its screen is bigger (irrelevant, we all use external monitors)\\n\\nDisadvantages: incredibly loud fan, gets very hot, sometimes bluescreens for no reason, and in combination with its gigantic power brick it weighs TWELVE POUNDS. I just put it on my kitchen scale to find out.\\n\\nNow I\\'m going to have to carry this thing to the bus stop, and then to the office (and then back again) a minimum of once a week and I really don\\'t feel like doing it. I do have a backpack of my own which can fit a 17\" laptop, but it\\'s a big canvas day-pack and a real pain to carry on the bus. Everyone else in the office was issued a laptop sleeve but they\\'re 15\" so it won\\'t fit. I also have an old shoulder injury from a manual job which flares up sometimes, and if I aggravate it doing this unnecessary thing, I won\\'t be happy.\\n\\nCan you get compatible power bricks for a ZBook that aren\\'t the size of a hardback Lord of the Rings? (maybe I could buy a nice laptop sleeve bag if it had a normal power brick?) Should I complain to my boss that I want a laptop that isn\\'t made of depleted uranium? Should I ask for a more appropriate bag for it?

English is a wide-range used language over the world.\\n\\nAnd it\\'s used for advertisements, YouTube videos, and more.\\n\\nSo you should take the advantage of this opportunity and represent yourself as an English native speaker.\\n\\nKnowing that these countries have English voice-overs, but they aren\\'t native speakers so you will have the advantage however you\\'re a beginner.\\n\\nSo, how to get into their communities to start offering your voice-over work?\\n\\n**Facebook Groups:**\\n\\nFacebook groups have a great opportunity for you, as there are many groups for voice-over in many countries which have customers who want to hire an English voice-over.\\n\\nAll you want to do is search for these groups by country.\\n\\nSearch for **\"\\\\[Country Name\\\\] Voice-Over\"**, and you can translate it for the country language for more results.\\n\\nMiddle East countries and Arabian ones as Egypt, UAE are good countries to start with, you can search for voice-over groups there.\\n\\nJoin groups with a bigger number of subscribers and not dead groups to have a better opportunity.\\n\\n**How to start?**\\n\\nIf you\\'re interested to become a voice-over with your native English, there is another surprise for you.\\n\\nYou just need a budget microphone and a quiet room.\\n\\nThere\\'re many budget microphones that will be more than enough for voice-over work.\\n\\nAll you want to do is connect it to the computer with a USB cable and start recording.\\n\\nAlso, you\\'re gonna need audio software to edit your voice to optimize it for the customer\\n\\nThere are many audio programs that are easy to learn and have many tutorials to learn from YouTube.\\n\\n[Adobe Audition](https://www.adobe.com/mena_en/products/audition.html?skwcid=AL!3085!3!340845132238!e) is a great one to learn, it costs $20.99/ month which is considered cheap, and has a free trial so you can test the software\\n\\nIf you considering being good with your budget at the beginning, you can use [Audacity](https://www.audacityteam.org/) or [Ocenaudio](https://www.ocenaudio.com/) which are free programs, and also have many tutorials on YouTube.\\n\\nAfter getting a microphone and learning software, you should practice some examples, like making a voice-over for ADs or a movie\\'s teaser to show these examples to your customers when you offer your work for them.\\n\\n**The Pay**\\n\\nVoice-over actors are well-paid, the cost of a 1-minute video could cost between $25 to more than $200!\\n\\nAnd you as a native English speaker have the advantage to require higher pay from the customer.\\n\\nOr require lower pay, and the customer should appreciate this and start working with you.\\n\\nSo what do you think about being a voice actor? let me know in the comments below!',\n",

Had kids, started working from home whenever I needed to and worked from home 3-5 days per week for a few years prior to covid. Since covid, I\\'ve been to the office 3x total for meetings. \\n\\nI got a call from my boss to tell me I got s 4% raise.  Great! I was happy to get anything because I really do get paid well for what I do.  Anyway, I was thankful, honored. He then tells me that he thinks something is \"coming\" which would be an initiative of some sort to get everyone back in the office.  I said oh.  He then said that they\\'re doing some moving around of offices in the office and he has an open office that I can have (I have a cubicle there that I don\\'t use).  I\\'d be able to close the door if covid is still a concern for me. I was quiet.  He then said,  \"think about it and let me know.\"  I thanked him again, he changed the subject and we hung up. I\\'ve been sick to my stomach ever since.\\n\\nFirst of all, you can\\'t woo me in to the office with an office!  I don\\'t give a shit. I LOVE working from home! I workout on my lunch each day, lost 30 lbs and getting healthier each day. I take my kids to school (no need for before care), I\\'m able to go to their plays, assemblies during the day (pre-covid times apparently because they don\\'t have them anymore which is sad) . My dog has epilepsy so I\\'m here if she has a seizure (that\\'s just an extra perk, it doesn\\'t keep me home, we manage her condition nicely). \\n\\nIf I were to work from the office again, I\\'d have gas costs since the office is 40 minutes from my home. There\\'s wear and tear on my car. There\\'s time LOST that I could be working just in commute time. I would need to pay for before care unless I can just saunter in at 9:40am each day, leavingby 5:15 no later. I can\\'t necessarily work out at lunch, nowhere in the office is conducive to working out.  I pay for after care because sometimes my day doesn\\'t end in time while working from home and I need care for my 8/10 year olds. \\n\\nShould I argue all this? Should I compromise to 1-2 days per week and then slack back off with my boss because he doesn\\'t care? \\n\\nCome the summer, I will also be working from a coastal resort because 1) my kids are busy and happy there and 2) why not, I have internet and pay rent there.  Working from the office will hinder that. I have done this 2 years so far with no issues with my boss. \\n\\nLet me just let you know I have a stressful job that does NOT require me to be on video but I have my share of conf calls. I\\'m not in management and do not manage anyone else.  There are 15 others just like me that work remotely either full time or part time. A few (including me for one of my offices)  don\\'t live in the same states they service sooooo.  Same shit. Make them come to the office too! Not really, I wouldn\\'t say that but shit.

I've been working as a virtual assistant (independent contractor) for the same client for about a year and a half now.

I didn't think anything of it until about 6 months ago when I realized that that's not how it should be. My understanding (for US laws) is that *clients don't get to put any sort of demands on independent contractors' time*, and that the *IC should be able to work 100% on their own terms*. \\n\\nI recently told my client that I'd like to switch to a different structure where there are no weekly or biweekly time demands. I want to receive my retainer at the beginning of the month and then proceed to work my hours as it suits me (if I choose to do all of my hours for the month in the span of one week, then I should be allowed to do that...no?), ensuring I'm completing the assigned projects within that month. My client, however, is putting up some resistance, saying that she needs to be able to assign me time sensitive tasks. \\n\\nI realize that I get to set the terms of my services, but I'm really struggling to advocate for myself in this situation. So my two questions are: \\n\\n* **Do I have the right idea about the working terms for an IC** **(in that no one gets to tell them when they work)?** \\n* **How can I advocate for myself with this client?** \\n\\nAny and all tips/words of wisdom/advice would be greatly appreciated!

First 3 years were 40 hours strictly in the office. \\n\\nThe next 2 years were hybrid (allowed to work 2-3 days from home/week). But no one followed this because it was a loose rule to begin with. Common in corporate I guess. \\n\\nThe past two years, it’s been strictly WFH. We can’t even go into the office if we wanted to. At this point, just one required day in the office would make a world of difference. WFH has frozen me into little to no productivity. What’s worse is, I’m accepting this as “normal” and it’s creating astronomical guilt within me. \\n\\nI understand the whole “have a routine/schedule” aspect, but it‘s much more than that. My team lead lacks empathy, talks over me, puts his thumb on the scale on ANY work I do. He was hired the same day I was 7 years ago and 3 people have been hired and quit as a result of his behavior. He’s the super industrious type. The kind of worker you’d want if you were a director, tbh. But he is simply intolerable. There is no human aspect on any workday. As a result, it disenchants me from even caring to do my job. \\n\\nIt’s honestly a miracle I haven’t been canned yet. I’ve taken this mentality of “I’ll just ride this ship into the ground, if they fire me, whatever “ and that’s honestly how I feel. Even despite the financial implications and life changes this would cause, I’d have such a breath of such air knowing I could make it work elsewhere and wouldn’t be confined to this shit work and shit team dynamic. That is the truth. \\n\\nI knew from the jump the industry I’m in wasn’t “the one” - but the pay, 401k, benefits, etc. are excellent. But my inner voice is just screaming “you don’t like this job, it’s time to move on”. \\n\\nI could rattle on for days about this. But I’m curious, anyone else in a perceivably “good spot” career-wise but doesn’t feel like they are at all from a mental health angle? \\n\\nGuilt is steadily rising and it’s worrisome that I’m just allowing it to consume me to the point of being immobilized.

       " 628: {'text': \"What Would You Do? On January 9th 2022 I got an offer of employment from a company that has a contract with the well-known computer hardware company. The offer start date was February 2, 2022. I had many issues from them and support until today, 2/4/22. First off, on the second I was able to sign into an online meeting for orientation at 1:00 p.m. Central Time on a web browser. I was advised in the chat area of the meeting that I needed to sign off and download the app that corresponded to that web browser site and come back into the meeting. When I downloaded the app it was a corrupt file and I redownloaded it and it would not finish the task. It was almost as if somehow the corruption of that file damaged the hardware. The reason I say that is that my modem/router also mysteriously stopped working. The support ticket for this episode was escalated to a gentleman in their main office and he flat out told me that it sounded him that I probably was going to need to have them replace the hardware. I volunteered to try to obtain a new modem today so that I could determine if it in fact was the computer that was the trouble with if the modem was fixed. I had a little difficulty locating the modem in my town and ordered it from Amazon and send an email to the folks that were supporting me in that regard because they had indicated earlier that they were going to send hardware to me if need be which would clearly not be here until Monday or Tuesday. I sent an email saying that I had not been able to locate what I needed locally and then I'd ordered it on Amazon and I was going to have it tomorrow Saturday and I got a email back saying if you can't get on to the network by close of business  then the offer is rescinded. Which puzzled me considering I had already been told that it was very possible that the problem was their hardware. I was a little bit upset but had somehow forgotten about office Depot and I went there and I got exactly what I need when I came back to my house and connected the new modem to the internet it worked just fine and when I connected it to the computer computer still not working so clearly we were able to let isolate that it was in fact their hardware that was now damaged probably by that corrupt file which probably also damage my modem and why I had to replace it. So I emailed the gentleman I was working with to let him know what the outcome was and he said and before I mean his email and mine crossed I got his at 5:25 Central Time saying that well kind of just kidding it's not before and the business and we're going to resend the offer but you know we understand what happened we think you should reapply for the position. And I'm like what???? I didn't really respond because I did not want to potentially say anything that I would regret or write anything that I would regret later. I said I did what you asked me to do and nobody told me that you know I had a 5:25 deadline you would actually indicated a little bit later than that 6:00 which would give plenty of time to connect a computer that was working to the internet that was the end of the conversation. I live in at will work state and the contract that I signed or the agreement that I signed is very clear that it was at will. Is there anything that I can do for my trouble? I came off the job market for essentially a month because of signing their offer and they didn't really do the things they said they were going to do in the short run the time got compressed from 6:00 to 5:25 which made a difference they had indicated that the hardware on their end may have to be replaced they aren't doing that they're just not being flexible at all and in fact I think there should be some sort of punitive measure if possible because this is putting me in a bad circumstance. I don't know if there's any lawyers here or if anybody has an opinion but I'm guessing I ought to be talking to an employment attorney and thank you for reading this I wanted to get this written down and presented in front of this audience to see if anybody had any opinions and all so to make sure that I didn't miss anything thank you.\",\n",

I have a wireless keyboard and mouse as well for what it\\'s worth. At the moment I\\'m have my laptop up on a DIY stand that I quickly threw together one morning before a meeting out of some spare wood I had at the house.\\n\\nOption 1: Dual Monitor Stand: Pretty self explanatory, looking at [this](https://smile.amazon.com/gp/product/B09712RBWB/ref=ox_sc_saved_image_2?smid=A3URZTWFDKUF47&amp;psc=1) on Amazon. I can put the two monitors on either side and the laptop in the middle. My desk is 23\" deep and about 59\" long so it would fit no problem. I like the idea of the drawers underneath for organization, but my keyboard would not fit in the middle (no big deal).\\n\\nOption 2: Get a dual monitor mount and mount them on my desk to save even more space. I\\'d have to get this [Vesa Mount Kit](https://smile.amazon.com/gp/product/B00RTS5WWM/ref=ox_sc_act_image_2?smid=A3W3STWCK1O3NR&amp;psc=1) and I was looking at this [Dual Mount Stand](https://smile.amazon.com/gp/product/B009S750LA/ref=ox_sc_act_image_1?smid=A3W3STWCK1O3NR&amp;psc=1) .

I commute 45 minutes each way. I’ve been asking for a laptop now for 6 months. I do not get the work remote privilege that my coworkers get and am expected to report to the office everyday (design work, really could wfh permanently) or otherwise take PTO/unpaid time. Is this fair? I have had some close calls driving on snow and ice to the office while most of my coworkers can comfortably and safely stay home and work.

My job is 100% unhindered when working from home and there is nothing I gain from being in the office. For Jan. 2022, they had everyone stay home 'if you can' to quote an internal email. At first, I thought this was because of the rising spike in Omicron cases, but I soon learned it was more due to a movement from the US federal government to place more requirements on US businesses in order to have people working in office. Classic case of corporate propaganda where they pretend as they care about the people, but really it was for the sake of riding out the bill going through the government and waiting to see what the results would be and a bit of copying what other businesses were doing.\\n\\nThe moment that motion from the government failed, they immediately asked EVERYONE to come back in. Again, to paraphrase another internal email: 'we're so happy we can bring everyone back together in office again. We've missed being able to work together in office'. It's enraging; the few different businesses I have worked for since the start of the pandemic have all played this same song and dance and act like everyone just loves to work in office when it's really more that they don't want people to be at home because they feel it's a loss in production. I am willing to admit that there are some people who genuinely thrive off being in office with their fellow executive-business-bros, but to throw people back and forth between home and office without giving anyone a choice either way is getting on my nerves.\\n\\nWhat's worst of all is that my boss is such a rule follower and she just has those on her team follow this back and forth switching bs. She's open to the idea of people working 100% remote, but only if they have a 'legitimate' reason. Conversely, throughout 2021 I lead a team at a different company and gave everyone a choice. And wouldn't you know, people got to choose, felt happier, and I got a stinking promotion and hefty raise because my team was absolutely slaughtering everyone else in terms of performance.\\n\\nIt really feels like those in charge have a mix of genuinely thinking everyone is miserable working form home and wants to be in office ASAP with a dark underbelly of just not trusting the average person to work from home. All I want is a choice. The way it is now, they say if you hit X metric you can work from home every other Friday. That's complete shit; hinging work from home on a very limited basis and tying it to a performance metric does the exact opposite of making me work hard to meet the metric. They do have us work from home regularly in the middle of the week (Tue. and Wed. with alternating Fridays) but that directly feeds into my point: Why in the hell are they having us work from home some days and then not other days or flat out making it a choice? And let me clarify, they DON'T stagger in office attendance. EVERYONE in IT/Helpdesk works in office Mon. and Tues. and then works from home Wed. and Thurs. with alternating Fridays being a work from home/work in office rotation. WHY!?!? That's just tedious.\",\n",

I’ve never had intention of leaving and thought I could work my way up the corporate ladder. It’s a smaller company, maybe 400-500 employees, and offers great benefits. It is a 9-5, M-F office job. \\n\\nWhen COVID started, I was one of the lucky ones who got to WFH. I went through a promotion to a different dept during that time and still got to keep my WHF abilities for practically 2 years, although occasionally I did have to go hybrid, just to end up being sent back to full WFH over and over again. In January, I switched teams and was forced back to office. Supervisor told me that only salaried employees should be allowed to work from home and that my job is one that can’t really be done from home… when I’d ALREADY BEEN doing this job from home for the past year with no problems. I suddenly felt like a lowly little staff member despite my tenure and success at my company.\\n\\nThis led me to apply for other jobs that offered WFH capabilities. I applied and landed an offer at a big4 for a 49% increase in my annual pay that is fully remote right now. When offices open, it will be hybrid 1-2x/wk in office. \\n\\nSeems like a no brainer but need reassurance. For some reason I keep second guessing myself on what I should do. It’s probably just fear holding me back, but I don’t know. I’m worried about leaving after I spent so much time with my company.

       " 696: {'text': 'Deciding which bedroom to use as study in new house Hi all, thanks for reading just looking for some opinions. I\\'m moving to my new house on Tuesday. The house has 2 bedrooms and 1 will be used as a study. I can\\'t decide which one to use. I\\'ve been WFH for 2 years now but my current house has 2 identical rooms so was never really a question of where to put study\\n\\nBedroom 1: as you walk through the front door you enter the corridor in the house. You turn left and there is bedroom 1. This bedroom is \"streetside\" in the sense that it is closest to the street and the closest room to the street in the entire house. It has massive windows looking out over what is a front courtyard and of course my front gate (front gate is only 1.5 metre high) so if I keep the curtains open I may see some people walking by (distraction or comfort I dunno? I usually keep curtains pretty closed as I don\\'t like seeing people that much, don\\'t mind hearing them though). Bedroom 1 will be the noisier room regarding the occasional cars and passer-bys, will also get more light due to facing out of house and bigger windows. This means my gut says to put my office in here. It\\'s slightly bigger than the other room which may be strange, but I will spend equal if not more time in my study than sleeping in my room. It also is where the fibre router will be located so maximum internet speeds.. I can\\'t decide if the noise is a con or a pro, however I think having the office nearer to the \"huddle and bussle\" may help feeling like an office? Main con would be that when I sleep I may not be able to hear someone trying to sneak into the property and that front room will have my most valuable household items in it (screens and laptop etc)\\n\\nBedroom 2: if you walk further down the entrance corridor you get bedroom 2 also to the left (it\\'s a narrow long house all to one side, not a wide double sided house, there is no \"right\" side). The rooms are back to back and the first two rooms of the house  This room is slightly smaller due having more cupboards in it. Has a little window with a single blind on it. It also has an aircon in this room. This room will be quieter of course and it\\'s further from the street. It will have less light due to a smaller Window, probably better for sleeping. \\n\\nThereafter the house has a lounge and kitchen and then a big back sealed off courtyard\\n\\nIs the noisier brighter room always the office, the quieter darker room the bedroom? My current house is more square so both rooms are \"streetside front facing\" and both fairly noise so it hasn\\'t been a question for me. Initially I was going to move with 2 beds and just figure it out but now I gave one to my sister so I just have 1 massive and immovable bed so I wanna try get it right. Thanks!',\n",

The pain will just be uncomfortable when sitting, but when I stand up and releive pressure is when I actually feel the radiating pain from my tailbone area.   \\n\\n\\nI'm a pretty tall dude, and so I usually have the chair at the lowest possible setting. This is better so I can look up, or, look at my monitors instead of looking down at them, which hurts my neck.   \\n\\n\\nBut this chair situation is just becoming too much of a problem. I'm debating on whether I should try a gel-pillow-support thing for my rear end. Or just bite the bullet and buy a new chair. I would just hate to drop a couple hundred on a nice new chair just too have the problem not go away. \\n\\nAny advice from people who have delt with this? Should I just try sticking a pillow underneath my 'tush in the meantime?  \\n\\n\\nThanks! x\",\n",

Since the lockdowns started and WFH began everything just went to shit. \\n\\nAfter the first year I ended up putting on a lot of weight, and my weed habit went rapidly out of control. My issue was and still is making myself focus. When I was in the office I did have an issue with checking my phone too much or my mind straying off task, but being sat around my team meant that I couldn’t slack off because it would be obvious. I received good praise for the work quality and quantity so all was well. \\n\\nSince WFH I just can’t keep myself on task and keep delaying doing work, usually with the rationalisation of “oh I can just catch up tomorrow morning/this evening”, but of course when that times comes around I don’t catch up. \\n\\nI ended up taking an extended sick leave to go through counselling, starting the gym, and quitting my drug habit. All around I’m much healthier and happier, and returning to work on 50% hours has helped a lot. \\n\\nHowever, I’m now facing the point where my hours are going to go back up and my tasks are getting harder. And this is stressing me out as I’m already struggling to get the productive hours in. \\n\\nI can manage tasks that are well defined and closed ended not too badly, but my latest piece of work is very open ended and I have to define the approach myself and it makes it so much more daunting and harder to get started. \\n\\nI’ve asked to return to the office but it would mean over an hour and a half of commuting each day, and I don’t think I’d even be around anyone else while working. \\n\\nI’ve been considering going through an ADHD screening process, but I was always able to get by in school by coasting so there’s no history to support it. I do struggle with appointments, attentiveness, impulsivity, and general memory. \\n\\nI just really fear for my future now that the industry is really embracing work from home. \\n\\nI’ve tried all sorts of context cues and meditation and list making, but I can’t get past this. \\n\\nI don’t know if I’m asking for advice or just rambling, sorry this is so long',\n",

Here’s how a typical morning usually goes: I set my alarm for 8am bc that’s when I’m supposed to start work. Then I fall back to into a light sleep, waiting for my phone to start pinging with email notifications. Every ping is another person asking me for shit when I already feel overwhelmed. I resent every one of those dings, even though my logical brain knows that’s ridiculous and they are perfectly within their right to email me during work hours. I stay in bed and lay there,  looking at my phone every time it makes that awful ding noise. I look to make sure it’s not someone important that I need to respond immediately. Then, if I’m lucky, around 10am I drag myself to my desk and bring my comforter with me, so it sorta still feels like I’m in bed even though I’m sitting up. And then the hell of work begins. Impersonal emails exchanges with people I’ve never met and probably will never meet. Everything feels so transactional and devoid of any true human emotion or connection. The day goes by with me feeling a gross combination of extremely overwhelmed and also extremely bored. My brain doesn’t know if it should fall into a deep sleep or work faster than I ever have in my life, anxiety fueling my every action. The combination of being so bored yet overwhelmed with boring, meaningless tasks is horrible place to live in. At the end of the day, I’m no where near done with what I need to do, and I could easily keep working till 2 or 3am. But then around 5ish I feel unaccomplished and unsatisfied. It sometimes makes me want to keep working so I can have something to say for myself and feel good about what I did that day. It feels weird turning the madness that is my work computer off bc I don’t feel like I’ve done anything worthwhile. Then I get back into bed, overeat overpriced delivery food. \\n\\nIt’s so weird and unnatural to work and sleep and eat in one room day in and day out. It feels so strange. \\n\\nI don’t know, that’s how my depression manifests itself in the WFH world. I feel detached, lonely, aimless, kinda like a really odd person who is attempting to assimilate into a world that doesn’t understand them. \\n\\nIt’s not always so bad, occasionally one of the doctors I support will say something odd or really out of place over email and it’s so unexpected and actually hilarious, like laugh out loud funny, yet they have no clue they are being funny. I cherish those sweet moments of much needed comic relief. I hold those people and the unintended moment of joy they blessed me with, close to my heart.',\n",

I have to walk 30 minutes everyday to and from work, and while it’s good for my health in a way, I am not eating healthy anymore as I have no will to cook after a long day. I miss my parents and I stay worried for them. \\n\\nNow I am looking for a strictly remote job. And thinking of branching out.

As mentioned before, merging your personal and work environments is undoubtedly challenging at first, but taking care of yourself is a great foundation for succeeding.\\n\\nNext, why not take advantage of the flexible schedules, time saved from not commuting, all the other perks of remote work, and make the most out of them?

I feel really discouraged but clearly I didn't end my life so some part of me wants to keep going even though I have no one. Does anyone know of any work from home jobs that suit my level of experience? If training for a field would be best, what would take the least amount of time? It sounds lazy but I genuinely can't take my current job much longer. Also, any general advice about work/health/finances is appreciated as I wasn't taught about any of it. Thanks.\",\n",

It's great to be here when my baby needs me, but I feel like I deal with soooo many distractions. My SO is a freelancer and also WFH so he bears the major childcare load while I'm working, but I can still hear the baby crying, microwave and other appliances, and my cat is usually glued to me like a magnet. I often feel guilty/anxious and go help when I hear the baby, unless I'm on a call. Maybe I also do it because I'm bored at my desk and have cabin fever. \\n\\nBefore I had my baby I was in a high-profile managerial position in an office at a plant for my company for 8 years. There was a lot of pressure to work really hard, and there was always a lot more work than time to do it in. There were distractions there too, but they were different (meetings, phone calls, employees stopping in). My new role is technical and I no longer manage people. The work is more relevant to my background and more enjoyable to me.  I travel 30% or so and WFH the rest of the time. My workload is also currently less than the job I had before, although it's important work as strategic decisions are based off of my research. Strangely, in this new role I somehow lack the discipline to stay on task and now I'm behind on work. In fact, instead of working right now I'm on Reddit.\\n\\nI want to make this work, but I'm feeling frustrated with my settings. Also, I'm getting ready to resume grad school (online), so I'm going to be spending even more time in front of the computer.

It pays $20/hr, the insurance benefits are good, and I work from home. My shift is 8:30 AM-5 PM PST and they require a mandatory 5 hours of OT every week, on top of one Saturday shift per month (and this is only for my department). I take anywhere from 80-100+ calls on a daily basis. I’ve had numerous coworkers quit over the past few months, out of nowhere. My stress and anxiety has never been this high, until I started this job. I have headaches on a daily basis, I can’t go to bed at a normal time anymore, I barely enjoy my weekends, because I am so anxious about going into work on Monday. I have rent and other bills, which put me in a place where I can’t afford to quit. I’m planning on moving out of state in a few months, and I was planning on transferring with the job, but I can’t see myself lasting a few more months with this company. My job has a chat department, and my manager knows I’m interested, but I keep getting the run around, and they want 90% adherence every month, which isn’t retainable; and they still make people from that department hop on the phones every now and then. I’ve applied for several email/chat positions over the past few days; and I’ve gotten a few rejection letters, but other than that I haven’t heard anything back. I do go to therapy, but it doesn’t do a lot lately, because I know what my main cause of stress is. After I leave this job, I don’t ever plan on working in another call center again. I deal with social anxiety and although its gotten better, I’m not ready to go back to a face to face customer position (I also don’t have a car anymore). I deal with a visual-spatial learning disability, so it makes the kinds of jobs I can do very limited. I really could use some advice on what my next steps should be, because I really see myself quitting during one of my shifts, and running the risk of being evicted out of my apartment, since I don’t have another job lined up.\n",

      "I've been working for a telecommunications company for some time now and this company has a ton of clients. A lot of us have been with the company long enough to be passed around quite often from client to client just to stay working. Needless to say, when you're  constantly changing clients of course your managers and other leaders change. And with that comes different managing styles. I've had really awesome managers and some that are crap so now whenever I'm told I have to move or there will be a new manager I start to get anxious. \n",
      "\n",
      "This leads me to the point of my post. So I just recently change campaigns again and my new manager is basically never available. To be honest almost none of the managers are ever available unless they need something from you. We reach out constantly to management for things that only they can make decisions about or have the answers for and they completely ignore us. So we are left with no guidance or resources to do our job correctly. They change processes and don't communicate it to us or if they do they don't tell us how we are to do it. Just left with no directions on how they want it done.The biggest problem is we are also left to have to reach out to tenured staff for guidance or to each other and its basically like the blind leading the blind. Different people not getting the guidance they need and are finding work arounds just to get the job done for the client. We have complained constantly about the lack of communication to our bosses and to each other. Some of the excuses we get is that they are busy. They don't read emails and don't answer back to messages. Almost never respond to anything and if they do respond you're met with a \"what?\" Or them giving you a partial answer. You may have a full list detailing what you need from them and explanations why. I've tried to make my emails as organized and as clear and easy to read as possible. But still they are half assed read or not read at all. And of course little to no response given.\n",
      "\n",
      "Which brings me to the next issue. My assistant manager had the AUDACITY... after they and my manager does not read or respond to our messages to yell in meetings about expectations not being met. And shit is don't incorrectly. We are literally working off of no guidance at all and left to figure things out or to try to ask for help and pray the people you ask knows. This has happened to me on more than one occasion where I was berated and yelled at for not knowing or not doing something or doing it incorrectly. I finally had a meltdown the last time and flipped out and told them how am I supposed to know and you're not communicating or giving us access to resources. There are things you know and have but you are not sharing with the team unless you have \"time\" to so naturally there are gaps in our knowledge.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "So fast forward to the most recent meeting my POS manager says. The reason why I do what I do in not \"giving you the answers\" is that I want to see what you know. I want to see your mind work. I want to know if you are going to come to me or are you going to seek at the information from your peers or on your own. They stated that their ultimate goal is to make the team as self sufficient as possible. And while I understand what they say are trying to do. I think they are full of shit. I think they don't want to be bothered and this is the best answer that they can give. Because they set these expectations and do not give the proper guidance and resources to even find the answer on our own. The team is suffering.  The client is unhappy. They are getting in trouble and then they point the blame at us and pull us into meetings and call us out and end up berating us on why shit is fucked up and wrong. Or ask what is going on with something we already sent emails and constant messages and reminders about but they failed to respond, come to a decision, or guide us on what they would like us to do. We are always left to rely on co workers who don't know much more than we know. \n",

      "An uncommon guide to becoming a digital nomad: Or how to get a remote work job in 3 weeks  Hey Y’all!\n",
      "\n",
      "Discovered this subreddit last month and have been loving it! I’ve been a remote worker for 3yrs now and never imagined the community being so large on Reddit. Feel like I found a secret tribe! I figured I better contribute something to the workfromhome community as I’ve been stealing ideas and inspiration from everyone else. So, I created a little guide about the process I use to get remote work jobs in just 3 weeks as I know there are some people on here who are probably dreaming about becoming a remote worker (as I once was) and are not sure how to get started. The usual “start your own business” advice can seem daunting and out of many comfort zones, as it was mine, so this will focus on the process of getting *employee* remote work positions. If you already are a remote worker then this post won’t be for you- but for those looking to get “in the game” then I’m positive you’ll be able to pick up something of value to use on your journey!\n",
      "\n",

Either way enjoy and feel free to message me on [Instagram ](http://instagram.com/corybeardsley_)if you have any questions at **corybeardsley\\_** . I’d be happy to help! I know how difficult this process was when I first started and how much I could’ve used someone so don’t hesitate to slide into my dm’s lol. I’m only signed into reddit on my computer so I don’t typically see messages for a bit but I’ll try to stick around for the day and answer any questions in the chat. Cheers!\n",

      "Also, there are many ways to get a remote work job. This is just one of them. It’s not the fastest, best, or easiest. It’s just the way I’ve learned to go about it over the last two years and I’ve tried to condense it enough to fit on one page but sadly got a little carried away lol.\n",
      "\n",
      "&amp;#x200B;\n",
      "\n",
      "1. **Cover Letters**: Although some sites do still ask you to attach a cover letter file, most just have a section for you to type out your cover letter or state why you’re a good fit. My go-to template is: *Hey! Love what’s being done at (Company). (1 line to show you’ve at least Googled the company). Although I do have {job title or similar past role} experience, I understand that you get a lot of applicants and I don’t have years of experience, but I am so confident that this is a great fit that I am willing to do a one week trial period to show that I can handle the responsibilities of the role. If after a week you decide it’s not a great fit, I’d understand. Nothing to lose and either way you get a free week of work. If you’re interested you can reach out to {Email} for a quick reply!”*. No one has ever taken me up on the offer of a free trial. It’s just used to stand out quickly and get my foot in the door for a first round interview. Once I started using this cover letter template my interview requests jumped nearly 300% in a week (4 to 12).\n",
      "2. **Portfolio Site**: A key mental shift to adopt is that we are not trying to get a remote work job, we are trying to get *interviews* for a remote work job. A subtle but important perspective shift. The most underutilized way to do so? Portfolio Sites. You can create one for free by going to [WordPress.com](https://wordpress.com/). My site template is an opening *About Me* page which is very relaxed. I then include a *Projects* section, an *Experience* section, and a *My Approach* section. The *Projects* section includes two projects I worked on, whether personal or career based. *Experience* is a further elaboration on the 2-3 jobs listed on my resume including testimonials (more below) and the *My Approach* page is a video where I talk about time-management principles like Pareto &amp; Parkinson’s law for two minutes. This is so the hiring manager can see me “live” and helps speed up the dating process. In the onboarding process for [WordPress](https://wordpress.com/) I always select build (NOT store or write) and use my first &amp; last name for site title &amp; address. For themes I use Independent Publisher 2 and include a stock sunset pic for my header image alongside a gravatar (free with WordPress) which is the same image used across platforms (LinkedIn/Resume). If you don’t know how to build a website there are plenty of great videos detailing the process on YouTube, like this [one](https://youtu.be/TafbP_vOGN0). However, if you’re tech savvy enough (which you probably are if you’re on this subreddit) you can create one solo! \n",
      "\n",
      "https://preview.redd.it/xh0gubzkc6l81.png?width=669&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=6201cac9b708ac28e23600410e7a686e591de7fb\n",
      "\n",
      "1. **Resume (Visual CV)**: I always create a resume through [VisualCV](https://www.visualcv.com/es/) that I have linked out to the various pages on my portfolio site. VisualCV has a multitude of templates and also allows you to track data to see how many people viewed your resume and which links they clicked. They used to offer one free resume, but if that’s no longer the case it costs $18 for unlimited resumes. I use a standard experience/education combo for the thick of it, but also throw in a headshot and a sidebar that links out directly to the project pages on my portfolio site. You can create a linkable resume for free through Google Docs as well, although more difficult. The key is to have direct links to your portfolio site. \n",
      "2. **Applications (FlexJobs)**: LinkedIn. Indeed. Ziprecruiter. All great sites for exploring the remote job market and are used by millions of people worldwide. LinkedIn even has a feature now that allows you to search exclusively for remote work positions! How great! F\\*\\*\\* that noise. There’s only one site you need and it’s [*FlexJobs*](https://www.flexjobs.com/). I’m astonished this isn’t listed on every remote work guide. I have a borderline unnatural love for this app. What it does is scans through and verifies remote work jobs across the globe and uploads them to their site. From there you can create a search criteria that helps you find jobs aligned within your industry and preference. They have a bunch of bonus features too and will send a gift package once you get your job. In my experience, the majority of jobs that meet my criteria on the initially listed trio of career sites have been pyramid schemes, insurance hustles, or straight scams. FlexJobs saves you from having to validate each listing and prevents you from sending out useless applications. Full disclosure it does cost money ($10week/$15mth/$60yr) but it’s like having a VA for your job hunt and is well worth the cost. \n",
      "3. **Interviews**: I always create a resume-review monologue that I place in a Google Doc that I reuse for all my interviews. I split the screen between the document (about 1 page) and video chat when the interview starts. Having the interviewer appear smaller on my screen oddly calms me down and having the monologue ready helps save time in the preparation process. I adjust it slightly for each position to include key industry jargon and words directly used in the job posting but nothing more than a sentence or two. I also come prepared with a canned question to ask at the end which is a version of: *“You’ve actually done a great job explaining the role and answered all my questions here. I guess the only one I’m left with is whether it be me, or someone else, what would you like to see in the next 3-6 months to know you’ve made the right hire for the role”*. If it’s only the first round interview I typically pocket the question and transition to a version of “I’ve had a great time discussing the role and look forward to next steps” closer. Other than that I just spend an hour the night before reviewing the company's social media accounts to prepare. \n",
      "4. **LinkedIn:** You can learn to set one up [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qG4NF-2tt4c). I recommend having 500 connections. Once you get over 500 it stops tallying and appears simply as a 500+ which is further social proof to validate your online presence. Social proof and online validation is key when applying for a remote position and submitting your LinkedIn profile is often required for many job applications. To build up your network simply fill out your profile and go to the *my network* tab on the site. From there just click connect on *all* recommendations. 99% will not message you but if you want to reach out to specific people by all means go for it! Another way to leverage LinkedIn is to visit the profile page of companies you may be interested in working for and going to the *peoples* section. You can look for recruiters, talent acquisition, or hiring managers and connect with them. You can then message to set up a “time to talk” about a *specific* role, not a vague “position”. To find a specific role you can go to the company's LinkedIn profile under *jobs*. Also, you may encounter an individual you are interested in connecting with that does not have a connect option under their profile. To bypass this go to their page and select more. A new pop up will appear and you can select connect from there. \n",
      "5. **Testimonials**: Getting testimonials on your website or LinkedIn is one of the best forms of content to have in your remote-work job hunt. You can add in testimonials to the relevant experience sections of your portfolio site and include them on your LinkedIn profile as well. To request a testimonial from an individual on Linkedin go to their profile, select more, and click request recommendation. The template I use to ask for testimonial requests is: *Hi {first name}! Loved working with you and hope you're still enjoying your time at {company}. I’m reaching out because I’m applying for a full-time remote work position and am wondering if you could write a sentence or two about your experience working with me. If not, no worries, I totally understand if you’re too busy but even a one- or two- line reply would really make my day. Best- Cory.* Testimonials from LinkedIn can be copied into your portfolio site as well.\n",

I'm getting an L shaped desk to fit here, but I can't decide *how* I should fit it there. I can push the loveseat and chair more toward the stairs, but they can't be right against them (I have two toddlers who are climbers and WILL go over the bannister, so we need enough space between the stairs and chair to have a buffer). My problem is the windows. The sliding door and window above the loveseat both let in a lot of light. I thought about putting my computer on the 59\" wall, but I don't want glare. I also thought about putting it on the 48\" wall and just keeping the blinds over the sliding door closed if it's causing glare, but I also don't want to end up with a headache from the sun in my face as I'm working. I'm apprehensive to put the computer anywhere on the desk that's not against a wall (see reference to toddlers).
